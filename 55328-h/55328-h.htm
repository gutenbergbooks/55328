    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;A NARROW ESCAPE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was a nasty
      night, with a drizzling rain nearly as thick as a fog&mdash;a rain which
      obscured the signals and left the rails so slippery that a quick stop was
      almost impossible&mdash;yet just the sort of night to make a quick stop
      imperative if disaster were to be averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young John Steele, station-master, telegrapher, ticket-agent, and
      man-of-all-work in the lone shanty known on the railway map as Hitchen&rsquo;s
      Siding, ignored by all other maps, stood beside the telegraph instrument
      wondering whether the rain had affected the efficiency of the wires, or
      whether the train despatcher had gone crazy. Here was Number Sixteen, the
      freight from the west, coming in, and there were no orders for her. Number
      Three, known to the outside world as the &ldquo;Pacific Express,&rdquo; the fastest
      train on the road, was already forty minutes overdue, tearing westward
      through the night somewhere, and John did not know where. All he knew was
      that she was trying to make up lost time as well as the greasy metals
      would allow, and here he stood without orders!
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more he seized the key, and calling the despatched office in
      Warmington again demanded: &ldquo;What orders for Sixteen?&rdquo; Then he went
      outside, and on his own initiative kicked away the iron clutch that
      released the distant semaphore. The red star of danger glimmering through
      the drizzle to the east might hold the express if the driver saw it in
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Number Sixteen had drawn up to the platform, and as her conductor came
      forward Steele ran to meet him, shouting: &ldquo;Sidetrack your train, Flynn!
      Sidetrack her on the jump!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my orders?&rdquo; asked the conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no orders. <i>I</i> order you. Get her off the main line at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Your</i> orders! Well, for cold cheek&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele lost none of the precious moments in argument, but, turning from
      the angry conductor, yelled to the engineer: &ldquo;Whistle for the switch, and
      kick her back on to the siding. Number Three may be into you any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No youth in Steele&rsquo;s position has the right to give a command to an
      engineer over the head of a conductor, neither should his orders to the
      conductor be oral&mdash;they must be documentary. Steele was shattering
      fixed rules of the road, and he knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor of a perishable goods train thinks himself nearly as
      important as if he ran an express, so Flynn was rightly indignant at this
      sudden assumption of unlawful authority by a no-account youth at a
      noaccount station. But a conductor is usually in a comparatively safe
      place, while the driver of an engine must bear the brunt of a head-on
      collision, so the grimy Morton at the throttle did not stand on etiquette,
      but blew the whistle for an open switch and backed his train into the
      siding. Steele watched the switch light turn to safety again, heaved a
      sigh of relief, then put his stalwart arms to the lever and slowly pulled
      off the danger signal to the east, and left the main line clear for the
      through express.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this sweat about?&rdquo; cried Flynn. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Number Three?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied John quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know? Well, I&rsquo;m blessed! I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing, my impetuous
      youngster. If Number Three has lost more time, and I&rsquo;m ordered on to the
      next siding, you&rsquo;ll lose your job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John turned in from the platform to the telegraph-room, and Flynn followed
      him. As they advanced the instrument began a wild rataplan, and Steele
      paused, raising his hand for silence. Even Flynn, who did not understand
      its language, felt that the machine was making a frantic, agonised appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to that!&rdquo; cried Steele, a note of triumph in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it saying?&rdquo; whispered the conductor, awed in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Sidetrack Sixteen! Sidetrack Sixteen! In God&rsquo;s name sidetrack Sixteen!&rsquo;
      There&rsquo;s your orders at last, Flynn. It&rsquo;s lucky you didn&rsquo;t wait for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The final words were obliterated by a roar as of a descending avalanche,
      and the express tore past, ripping the night and the silence; fifty miles
      an hour at the least; the long line of curtained windows in the
      sleeping-cars shimmering in the station lights like a wavering biograph
      picture&mdash;there and away while you drew your breath. In the stillness
      that followed, the brass instrument kept up its useless, idiotic chatter.
      A heavy step sounded on the platform, and the engineer appeared at the
      door, his face ghastly in its pallor, the smudges on it giving a
      heightening effect of contrast.

    <p>
      &ldquo;God, Flynn,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;that was a close call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conductor nodded, and each man strode forward as if impelled by a
      single impulse to grasp hands with the youngster, who laughed nervously,
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re pretty anxious in the city. I must answer.&rdquo; Then he went to the
      instrument and sent the most undisciplined message that had ever gone over
      the wires from a subordinate to a superior.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;PROMOTION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the train
      despatcher&rsquo;s office at Warmington, one hundred and twenty miles to the
      east of Hitchen&rsquo;s Siding, the force was hard at work under the electric
      light. Philip Manson, division superintendent, strolled in, although it
      was long past his office hours, for he was one of those indefatigable
      railroad men loth to take his fingers off the pulse of the great
      organisation he controlled, and no employee of the road could be certain
      of any hour, night or day, when Manson might not be standing unexpectedly
      beside him. As this silent man surveyed the busy room, listening to the
      click of the telegraphic sounders, which spoke to him as plainly as if
      human lips were uttering the language of the land, he was startled by a
      cry from Hammond, the train despatcher. Hammond sprang like a madman to
      the sender, and the key, at lightning speed, rattled forth&mdash;&ldquo;Sidetrack
      Sixteen. Sidetrack Sixteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively the division superintendent knew what had happened. To the
      most accurate of men, faithful and exact through years of service, may
      come an unaccountable momentary lapse of vigilance. The train despatcher
      had forgotten Number Sixteen! Instantly the road spread itself out before
      the mind&rsquo;s eye of the superintendent. He knew every inch of it. The
      situation revealed itself to his mathematical brain as a well-known
      arrangement of men and pawns would display to an expert what could or
      could not be done on the chess-board. He knew where Number Three would
      lose further time on the up-grades, but now, alas! it was speeding along a
      flat country, where every minute meant a mile. Nevertheless, there was one
      chance in a thousand that the express had not yet reached Hitchen&rsquo;s, and
      his quick mind indicated the right thing to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him to stop Number Three,&rdquo; he snapped forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The despatcher obeyed. Where disaster was a matter of moments, there was
      little use in awaiting the slow movements of a heavy freight-train when
      the express, a demon of destruction, was swooping down on the scene. There
      came no answer to the frenzied appeal. Every man in the room was on his
      feet, and each held his breath as if the crash and the shrieks could leap
      across one hundred and twenty miles and penetrate into that appalled
      office. Then the sounder began, leisurely and insolent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I sidetracked Sixteen on my own, and set the signal against Three
      until Sixteen was in. Are you people crazy, or merely plain drunk?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tension snapped like an overstrained wire. One man went into shriek
      after shriek of laughter; another laid his head on his desk and sobbed.
      Hammond staggered into a chair, and an assistant held a glass of water to
      his ashen lips. The division superintendent stood like a statue, a deep
      frown marking his displeasure at the flippant message that had come in
      upon such a tragic crisis. But the assurance that the express was safe
      cleared his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man at the siding is named John Steele, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send down a substitute to-morrow, and tell Steele to report to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this is how our young man came to be Philip Man-son&rsquo;s right-hand
      helper in the division superintendent&rsquo;s office of the Grand Union Station
      at Warmington City.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grand Union Station is a noble pile of red brick, rough and cut stone
      and terra-cotta, adorned by a massive corner tower holding aloft a great
      clock that gives the city standard time. The tower is the pride of
      Warmington&mdash;a pillar of red cloud by day and a pillar of fire by
      night, with the hours distinct a mile away. The tower may be taken as a
      monument to the power and wealth of the Rockervelts, although in larger
      cities they possessed still more imposing architecture to uphold their
      fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Manateau Midland, which made this immense structure its eastern
      terminus, was merely a link in the Rockervelt chain of admirably equipped
      railways; but, as the title, Union, implied, other roads, mostly bankrupt
      lines or branches of the Midland, enjoyed running rights into the Grand
      Union Station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transferring of a country youth at an enhanced salary, from a lone
      pine shanty on the prairie to this palatial edifice in the city seemed to
      John like being translated bodily to heaven. Now he had his chance, and
      that was all he asked of fate. He delighted in railway work. The strident
      screech of the whistles, the harsh clanking of cars coming together, all
      the discordant sounds of the station-yard, were as orchestral music to
      him, and he never tired of the symphony. He speedily became the most
      useful man about the place, and was from the first the most popular. He
      had a habit of dashing here and there bare-headed, and to heat or cold was
      equally indifferent. There was not a trace of malice in the lad, and he
      was ever ready with a cheery word or a helping hand. He seemed able to do
      anything, from running an engine to tapping a wire, and was willing in an
      emergency to work night and day, without a grumble, till he dropped from
      fatigue. Silent Philip Man-son watched Steele&rsquo;s progress with unspoken
      approval, and loved him not the less that for all the lad&rsquo;s witty
      exuberance not a word had ever passed his lips about that sinister blunder
      at Hitchen&rsquo;s Siding. Those things are not to be spoken of, and even the
      general manager knew nothing of the crisis. The train despatcher had
      retired, nerve-broken, and the newspapers never guessed why.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one man who did not like John, and that was no less
      important a personage than the general manager himself. His huge room in
      the lower part of the tower was as sumptuously furnished as an eastern
      palace. T. Acton Blair, general manager of the Manateau Midland, was
      supposed to be related to the Rockervelt family, but this was perhaps a
      fallacy put forth to account for the placing of such a palpably
      incompetent man in so responsible a position. He was a bald-headed,
      corpulent personage, pompous and ponderous, slow moving and slow speaking,
      saying perfectly obvious things in a deep, impressive voice, as if he were
      uttering the wisdom of ages. His subordinate, Philip Manson, as everybody
      knew, was responsible for the efficiency of the road; and when he wanted a
      project carried out, he always pretended it was Blair&rsquo;s original idea, so
      the general manager got the credit if it was a success, and Manson
      shouldered the blame if it was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, as Philip Manson was about to leave the general manager&rsquo;s
      room, after the customary daily interview with his chief, the latter said:
      &ldquo;By the way, Manson, who is that individual who rushes about these offices
      at all hours, as if he thought he were running the whole Rockervelt
      system?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect you refer to John Steele, one of my assistants, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him, Manson; he seems obtrusive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, sir, he is a most capable man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I dare say; but, as I have often told you, the success of our
      organisation is in method, not in haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That person always gives me the idea that something is wrong&mdash;that a
      fire has broken out, or a man has been run over. I don&rsquo;t like it. His
      clothes are untidy and seem to have been made for some one else. I
      shouldn&rsquo;t like Mr. Rockervelt to see that we have such an unkempt person
      on our clerical staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to him, sir; I admit his manner does not do him justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Manson next encountered John alone, he spoke with more than his usual
      severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steele, I wish you would pay some attention to your clothes. Get a new
      business suit and take care of it. Remember you are in the city of
      Warmington, and not at Hitchen&rsquo;s Siding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said John contritely, looking down with new dismay at his
      grease-stained trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish also you would abandon your habit of running all over the place
      without a hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The catastrophe came with appalling suddenness. The Pacific Express Steele
      had saved, but himself he could not save.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tearing down the long corridor at breakneck speed, he turned a corner and
      ran bang into the imposing front of the general manager. That dignified
      potentate staggered back against the wall gasping, while his glossy silk
      hat rolled to the floor. John, brought up as suddenly as if he had
      collided with a haystack, groaned in terror, snatched the tall hat from
      the floor, brushed it, and handed it to the speechless magnate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very, <i>very</i> sorry, sir,&rdquo; he ventured. But Mr. Acton Blair made
      no reply. Leaving the culprit standing there, he put on his hat and strode
      majestically to the division superintendent&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manson!&rdquo; he panted, dropping into a chair, &ldquo;discharge that lunatic at
      once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The division superintendent was too straightforward a man to pretend
      ignorance regarding Blair&rsquo;s meaning. His face hardened into an expression
      of obstinacy that amazed his chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Rockervelt system is deeply indebted to Mr. Steele&mdash;a debt it
      can never repay. He saved Number Three last November from what would have
      been the most disastrous accident of the year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was I never told of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For three reasons, sir. First, the fewer people that know of such
      escapes, the better; second, Hammond, who was responsible, voluntarily
      resigned on plea of ill-health; third, Hammond was your nephew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. T. Acton Blair rose to his feet with that majesty of bulk which
      pertains to corpulent men. It was an action which usually overawed a
      subordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are making a mistake, sir, regarding our relative positions.
      I am general manager of the Manateau Midland, and as such have a right to
      be informed of every important event pertaining to the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your definition of the situation is correct. Both you and Mr. Rockervelt
      should have been told of the narrow escape of the express.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a glitter as of steel in the keen eyes of the superintendent,
      while the inflated manner of the manager underwent a visible change, like
      a distended balloon pricked by a pin. Mr. Blair knew well the danger to
      himself and his vaunted position if the event under discussion came to the
      knowledge of the great autocrat in New York, so he tried to give his
      surrender the air of a masterly retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, Mr. Manson, I don&rsquo;t know but you were right. The less such
      things are talked of, the better. They have a habit of getting into the
      papers, and undermining public confidence, and we should all try to avoid
      such publicity. Yes, you did quite right, so we will let it go at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about Mr. Steele?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, Manson, he is in your department, and you may do as you
      please. I should rather see him go, but I don&rsquo;t insist upon it. Good
      afternoon, Mr. Manson.&rdquo; The great man took his departure ponderously,
      leaving Manson somewhat nonplussed. As soon as the door to the corridor
      closed behind Blair, the door to Manson&rsquo;s secretary&rsquo;s room, which had been
      ajar during this conversation, flew open, and the impetuous Steele came
      rushing in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Manson,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but I was waiting to see you, and I
      could not help hearing part of what you and Mr. Blair said. I did not
      intend to listen; but if I had shut the door it would have attracted
      attention, so I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I suppose he told you we had a
      head-on collision, round a curve, with no signals out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man tried to carry it off jauntily with a half nervous laugh,
      but Manson&rsquo;s face was sober and unresponsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all my fault, and you had warned me before,&rdquo; continued Steele
      breathlessly. &ldquo;Now you stood up to the old man for me, and made him back
      water; but I&rsquo;m not going to have you get into trouble because of me. I&rsquo;ve
      discharged John Steele. I&rsquo;m going in now to Mr. Blair, and I&rsquo;ll apologise
      and resign. I&rsquo;ll tell him you warned me to quit rushing round, and that I
      didn&rsquo;t quit. I&rsquo;m sorry I telescoped him, but not half so sorry as that
      I&rsquo;ve disappointed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Manson severely. &ldquo;Go back to your desk; and let this rest
      for a day or two. I&rsquo;ll see the manager about it later on.&rdquo; He noticed the
      moisture in the younger man&rsquo;s eyes, and the quiver of his nether lip, so
      he spoke coldly. Emotion has no place in the railway business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I&rsquo;d never feel comfortable again. There&rsquo;s lots of work waiting
      for me, and it won&rsquo;t have to wait long. I&rsquo;m going for it as I went for Mr.
      Blair&rsquo;s waistcoat. But I want to tell you, Mr. Manson, that&mdash;that all
      the boys know you&rsquo;re a brick, who&rsquo;ll stand by them if they&mdash;if they
      do the square thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as if his disaster had not been caused by his precipitance, the youth
      bolted headlong from the room before Manson could frame a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The division superintendent put on his hat and left the room less
      hurriedly than John had done. He made his way to that sumptuous edifice
      known as the University Club. The social organisation which it housed had
      long numbered Manson as a member, but he was a most infrequent visitor. He
      walked direct to the cosiest corner of the large reading-room, and there,
      in a luxurious arm-chair, found, as he had expected, the Hon. Duffield
      Rogers, an aged gentleman with a gray beard on his chin and a humourous
      twinkle in his eye. Mr. Rogers was a millionaire over and over again, yet
      he was president of the poorest railway in the State, known as the Burdock
      Route, whose eastern terminus was in the Grand Union which Manson had just
      left. Rogers occupied a largely ornamental position on the Burdock, as he
      did in the arm-chair of the club. He was surrounded by a disarray of
      newspapers on the floor, and allowed the one he was holding to fall on the
      pile as he looked up with a smile on seeing Manson approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Manson! Is the Midland going to pay a dividend, that you&rsquo;ve got an
      afternoon off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> know about dividends?&rdquo; asked Manson, with a laugh. He
      seemed a much more jocular person at the club than in the railway-office,
      and he was not above giving a sly dig at the Burdock Route, which had
      never paid a dividend since it was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I read about &rsquo;em in the papers,&rdquo; replied the Hon. Duffield
      serenely. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that old stick-in-the-mud Blair? I&rsquo;m going to ask the
      committee of this club to expel him. He has the cheek to swell around
      here, in <i>my</i> presence, and pretend he knows something about
      railroading. I&rsquo;d stand that from you, but not from T. Acton Blair. He
      forgets I&rsquo;m president of a road, while he&rsquo;s only a general manager. I tell
      him I rank with Rockervelt, and not with mere G. M&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old millionaire laughed so heartily at his own remarks that some of
      the <i>habitués</i> of the reading-room looked sternly at the framed
      placard above the mantelshelf which displayed in large black letters the
      word &ldquo;Silence.&rdquo; Manson drew up a chair beside the old man and said
      earnestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came in to see you on business, Mr. Rogers. There is a young fellow in
      my office who will develop into one of the best railroad men of our time.
      I want you to find a place for him on your line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we&rsquo;re not taking on any new men. Just the reverse. We laid off the
      general manager and about fifteen lesser officials a month ago, and we
      don&rsquo;t miss &rsquo;em in the least. I&rsquo;ve been trying to resign for the
      past year, but they won&rsquo;t let me, because I don&rsquo;t ask any salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man will be worth double his money anywhere you place him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not saying anything against your man except that we don&rsquo;t want him.
      The Burdock&rsquo;s practically bankrupt&mdash;<i>you</i> know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, John Steele, the young fellow I&rsquo;m speaking of, won&rsquo;t want much
      money, and he understands railroading down to the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is a valuable man, why are you so anxious to get rid of him?&rdquo; asked
      the wily president, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;d rather part with all the rest of my staff than with Steele;
      but Mr. Blair has taken a dislike to him, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough said,&rdquo; broke in the president of the Burdock. &ldquo;That dislike,
      coupled with your own preference, makes the best recommendation any man
      could ask. How much are you paying Steele?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man mused for a few moments, then chuckled aloud in apparent
      enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him fifteen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will that satisfy him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will more than satisfy him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I pay the amount on one condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, Mr. Rogers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The condition is that he accepts and fills the position of general
      manager of the Burdock Route.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General manager!&rdquo; echoed Manson, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking seriously, Mr. Rogers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, Manson, so am I. And don&rsquo;t you see what a good bargain I&rsquo;m
      driving? You say Steele is first class. All right; I know you wouldn&rsquo;t
      vouch for him unless that were so. Very well. I get a general manager for
      fifteen dollars a week; cheapest in the country, and doubtless the best. I
      confess, however, my chief delight in offering him the position is the
      hope of seeing old Blair&rsquo;s face when he first meets in conference the
      youth he has dismissed, his equal in rank if not in salary. It will be a
      study in physiognomy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the staid Philip Manson thought that Steele&rsquo;s native modesty would
      prevent him from accepting the management of the Burdock Route, he was
      much mistaken. When Manson related quietly the result of his interview
      with the Hon. Duffield Rogers, the youth amazed him by leaping nearly to
      the ceiling and giving utterance to a whoop more like the war-cry of a red
      Indian than the exclamation of a Scottish Highlander. Then he blushed and
      apologised for his excitement, abashed by Manson&rsquo;s disapproving eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what it is, Mr. Manson, I&rsquo;ll make the roadbed of the old
      Burdock as good as you&rsquo;ve made the Midland, and I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; said Manson, in his most unenthusiastic tone; &ldquo;you can do
      nothing without money, and the Burdock&rsquo;s practically bankrupt. Be thankful
      if you receive your fifteen a week with reasonable regularity. Now, here
      is a letter to the Hon. Duffield Rogers. Give it to the doorman at the
      club, and Mr. Rogers will invite you in. You will find the president a
      humourous man and you have a touch of the same quality yourself; but
      repress it and treat him with the greatest respect, for humourists get
      along better with dull people like myself than with one another. Although
      you are leaving the jurisdiction of Mr. Blair, do not forget what I told
      you about paying attention to your clothes. You will be meeting important
      men whom you may have to persuade, and it is better to face them well
      groomed; a prepossessing appearance counts in business. Prepossession is
      nine points in the game. Here is the letter, so be off.&rdquo; The division
      superintendent rose and extended his hand. &ldquo;And now, my boy, God bless
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of the benediction sounded almost gruff, but there was a
      perceptible quaver underneath it, and after one firm clasp of the hand the
      divisional superintendent sat down at his desk with the resolute air of a
      man determined to get on with his work. As for John, he could not trust
      his voice, either for thanks or farewell; so he left the room with
      impetuous abruptness, and would have forgotten his hat if he had not
      happened to hold it in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the ordinary man the Burdock Route was a badly kept streak of defective
      rails, rough as a corduroy road. To John Steele it was a glorious path to
      Paradise; an air line of tremendous possibilities. He went up and down its
      length, not in a private car, but on ordinary locals and freight trains.
      He became personally acquainted with every section foreman and with nearly
      every labourer between Warmington and Portandit, the western terminus. He
      found them, as a usual thing, sullen and inert; he left them jolly and
      enthusiastic, almost believing in the future of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proved an unerring judge of character. The useless men were laid off,
      while the competent were encouraged and promoted. He could handle a shovel
      with the best of them, or drive in a spike without missing a blow. In a
      year he had the Burdock Route as level as a billiard-table without extra
      expenditure of money, and travelers were beginning to note the
      improvement, so that receipts increased. He induced the Pullman Company to
      put an up-to-date sleeper on the night trains, east and west, and withdraw
      their antiquated cars hitherto in use.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one thing Steele was not able to accomplish. He could not
      persuade the venerable president of the road to regard it as anything but
      a huge joke. The Hon. Duffield Rogers absolutely refused to leave his
      comfortable chair in the club and take a trip over the Burdock. The
      president delighted in Steele&rsquo;s company, and got him made a member of the
      club, setting him down as a graduate of the Wahoo University, which was
      supposed to exist somewhere in the remote West. Rogers was a privileged
      member and a founder of the club, so the committee did not scrutinise his
      recommendation too closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, John,&rdquo; he would say, when his fervent assistant urged him to
      come and see what had been done on the Burdock. &ldquo;Life is hard enough at
      best without my spending any part of it in a beastly place like Portandit.
      I hear you have done wonders with the road, but you can&rsquo;t accomplish
      anything really worth while with a route that has no terminus on the
      Atlantic. As long as you have to hand over your Eastern traffic to the
      Rock-ervelts at Warmington, and take what Western freight they care to
      allow you, you are in the clutch of the Rock-ervelts, and they can freeze
      you out whenever they like.=
    </p>
    <p>
      ```You may grade, you may ballast your road, if you will,
    </p>
    <p>
      ```But the shadow of Rockervelt&rsquo;s over you still."=
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Steele always received his discouragement from his own chief, and
      with most people this would ultimately have dampened enthusiasm; but John
      was ever optimistic and a believer in his work. One day he rushed into the
      club, his hat on the back of his head, and his eyes ablaze with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Rogers, I&rsquo;ve solved the problem at last!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I tell you, well
      make the Burdock the greatest line in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shoved aside the heaps of magazines from the reading-room table and
      spread out a map on its surface. The Hon. Duffield rose slowly to his feet
      and stood beside the eager young man. A kindly, indulgent smile played
      about the lips of the aged president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now see here!&rdquo; shouted Steele (they were alone together in the room, and
      the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; placard made no protest). &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Beechville, on the
      Burdock Route, and here&rsquo;s Collins&rsquo; Centre, on the C. P. &amp; N. Between
      these two points are sixty-three miles of prairie country, as level as a
      floor. It will be the cheapest bit of road to build in America; no
      embankments, no cuttings, no grade at all. Why, just dump the rails down,
      and they&rsquo;d form a line of themselves! Once the Burdock taps the C. P.
      &amp; N., there is our route clear through to tide-water, independent of
      the Rockervelt System.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele, his face aglow, looked up at the veteran, but the indulgent smile
      had taken on a cynical touch. Mr. Rogers placed his hand on John&rsquo;s
      shoulder in kindly fashion and said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that were possible it would have been done long since. You could not
      get your charter. Rockervelt would buy the Legislature, and we in the West
      haven&rsquo;t money enough to outbid him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele&rsquo;s clenched fist came down on the map with a force that made the
      stout table quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> the charter!&rdquo; he roared, in a voice that made the
      doorman outside think there was trouble in the reading-room. The Hon.
      Duffield Rogers sank once more into his arm-chair and gazed at John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ve got the charter?</i>&rdquo; he echoed quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, and it didn&rsquo;t cost me a cent. The Governor signed it
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings&mdash;&rdquo; murmured the old man,
      who had years of experience behind him in the bribing of law-makers. &ldquo;In
      Heaven&rsquo;s name, how did you manage it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to the capital, became acquainted with the legislators&mdash;splendid
      fellows, all of them&mdash;personal friends of mine now; I showed them how
      such a link would benefit the State, and the bill went through like <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
       John snapped his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blessed!&rdquo; ejaculated the old-time purchaser of valuable
      franchises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Rogers, you understand financiering, and know all the
      capitalists. I understand the railway business. You raise the money, I&rsquo;ll
      build the road, and we&rsquo;ll be into New York with a whoop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For one brief instant Steele thought he had conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like an old war-horse at the sound of the bugle, Rogers stiffened his
      muscles for the fight. The light of battle flamed in his eye as the memory
      of the conquest of millions returned to him. But presently he leaned back
      in his chair with a sigh, and the light flickered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, John!&rdquo; he whispered plaintively, &ldquo;I wish I had met you thirty years
      ago; but alas! you weren&rsquo;t born then. What a team we would have made! But
      I&rsquo;m too old and, besides, your scheme wouldn&rsquo;t work. I might get up the
      money, and I might not. The very name of the Burdock is a hoodoo. But even
      if the money were subscribed and the link built, we would merely be
      confronted by a railroad war. The Rockervelts would cut rates, and the
      longest purse is bound to win, which means we should go to the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele sat down with his face in his hands, thoroughly discouraged for the
      first time in his life. He felt a boyish desire to cry, and a mannish
      desire to curse, but did neither. The old gentleman rambled on amiably:
      &ldquo;You are a ten-thousand dollar man, John, but your line of progress is on
      some road with a future. Follow my advice and take your charter to that
      old thief Rocker-velt himself. There lies your market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I do that,&rdquo; growled John from between his fingers, &ldquo;when I am an
      employee of the Burdock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Technically so am I; therefore, as your chief, I advise you to see
      Rockervelt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; cried Steele, springing to his feet as if his minute of deep
      despondency had been time thrown away that could not be spared. He shook
      hands cordially with the president, and returned his genial smile.

      CHAPTER III&mdash;-WAYLAYING A MAGNATE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the steps of the
      club he was surprised to meet Philip Manson, who, he knew, rarely honoured
      that institution with his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just going up to see you, Mr. Manson. I want you to do me a favour.
      I&rsquo;m off to New York, and I&rsquo;d like a letter of introduction to Mr.
      Rockervelt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brow of the division superintendent knitted slightly, and he did not
      answer so readily as the other expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like this, Steele,&rdquo; he said at last: &ldquo;I am merely a small
      official, and Mr. Rockervelt is an important man who knows his own
      importance. Etiquette prescribes that I should give you a letter to the
      general manager, who is the proper person to introduce you to Mr.
      Rockervelt. So, you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; exclaimed Steele, sorry he had asked. This rebuff,
      following so closely on the heels of his disappointment, clouded his usual
      good nature. He was about to go on, when Manson detained him, grasping the
      lapel of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be offended, John; and I&rsquo;ll tell you something no one else knows.
      I&rsquo;m going to quit the railway business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; shouted Steele, all his old affection for the man surging up
      within him as he now noted the trouble in his face. Manson quit the
      railway business! It was as if he had calmly announced his intention to
      commit suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That old fool Blair has been making trouble for you?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! That is to say, there always has been a slight tension, and it
      doesn&rsquo;t grow better. I&rsquo;ve made a little money&mdash;real estate has risen,
      you know, and that sort of thing&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve been working hard, so I
      intend to resign. I take it you have some scheme to propose to Mr.
      Rockervelt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Your scheme, if it is a good one, will prove your best
      introduction. He&rsquo;s an accessible man; but plunge right to the point when
      you meet him. He likes directness. And, by the way, he will be in
      Warmington on Wednesday morning. The big conference of railway presidents
      begins Thursday afternoon at Portandit, and he will be there, of course.
      We attach his private car to Number Three, Wednesday night, and your best
      time to see him might be in his car during the four miles he&rsquo;s running to
      the Junction. The express waits for him at the Junction. You haven&rsquo;t much
      time, but it will prove all the time he&rsquo;ll want to allow you if your
      project doesn&rsquo;t appeal to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; cried Steele, a thrill with the portent of a sudden idea, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t
      you persuade Rockervelt to hitch his car to the Burdock &lsquo;Thunderbolt&rsquo;?
      I&rsquo;ll run him through to Portandit, and save him that dreary daylight trip
      from Tobasco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manson shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Mr. Rockervelt would not go over any other road than his own. I could
      not propose such a thing, and Mr. Blair would not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele walked down to the Grand Union Station deep in thought. He had
      determined to take Rockervelt&rsquo;s private car from its place with one of his
      own pony engines and attach it to his own express, and he was formulating
      his plans. Once away from the Junction, the Government itself could not
      stop him. And now we need a railway map to explain the situation. From
      Warmington to Portandit or to Tobasco is a long night&rsquo;s ride. The
      &ldquo;Thunderbolt&rdquo; leaves the Junction on the Burdock Route at 8 p.m. The
      &ldquo;Pacific Express,&rdquo; on the Midland, departs at 8.20; one train from the
      south side of the station, the other from the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten minutes to eight Philip Manson received a telephone message asking
      him to remain within call. A short time after, when the men were coupling
      the private car to the west-bound train, Steele rushed in to the telephone
      cabin and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you, Mr. Manson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steele. I&rsquo;ve just coupled Rockervelt&rsquo;s car to the &lsquo;Thunderbolt.&rsquo; Release
      Number Three, for she will wait in vain. Telegraph all those people that
      Rockervelt was to meet at Tobasco to-morrow morning to take the midnight
      train for Portandit and meet him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steele, are you out of your senses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s all as I say. Nothing can stop us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the list of the men that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then call up Blair. He&rsquo;s in his private car on Number Three, which of
      course you know. You must get the list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Steele, I implore you to stop before it is too late. This is an
      outrage. It&rsquo;s kidnapping&mdash;brigand&rsquo;s work. You are breaking laws that
      will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know. Good night, Mr. Manson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one moment, John, I&rsquo;ve something important to tell you. Mr.
      Rockervelt telegraphed to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the young man was proof against all blandishments, determined to go
      his own way, so he rang off before his friend could finish the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steele rushed out to the platform, nodded to the waiting conductor, swung
      himself on the Pullman car, the conductor swung his lantern, and the
      &ldquo;Thunderbolt&rdquo; swung out into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the deft and silent negro had cleared away the breakfast dishes next
      morning and removed the tablecloth, Mr. Rockervelt leaned back in his
      chair and lit a cigar. There was much to think of, and he was thinking
      much. The car rolled along with gratifying smoothness, and the great man
      paid no attention to the scenery, otherwise he might have been startled,
      for he knew well the environment of his own line. As for the negro, all
      roads were alike to him, and he attended solely and silently to his
      master&rsquo;s comfort. He hovered about for a few moments, then said
      deferentially:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Day&rsquo;s a gennelman, sah, in de sleepah ahead&rsquo;s been asking for you, sah,
      two or three times dis mawning, sah. He&rsquo;d like to have some conversation
      with you, sah, if you&rsquo;s disengaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s cawd, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rockervelt glanced at the card, murmuring: &ldquo;John Steele, General
      Manager, Burdock Route. That&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo; Then aloud: &ldquo;Show Mr. Steele in,
      Peter.&rdquo; The magnate did not rise as John bowed to him, but waved his hand
      toward a chair, a silent invitation of which his visitor did not avail
      himself. He recognized the great man at once from the many portraits he
      had seen of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you have slept well, Mr. Rockervelt,&rdquo; began the new-comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I trust you found the road-bed in good order.&rdquo; Mr. Rockervelt raised
      his eyebrows and looked with some surprise at the polite inquirer before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own bed and the road-bed left nothing to be desired, since you are so
      kind as to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to hear you say so, sir,&rdquo; cried John with enthusiasm. His
      host began to fear some demented person had got into his car, and he
      glanced over his shoulder for Peter, who was not visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you be delighted to hear me praise my own road?&rdquo; he asked in
      tones that gave no hint of his uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, to tell you the truth, I wished a few minutes&rsquo; talk with you,
      and that&rsquo;s not as easy come by as you may think. You are not on your own
      road, but on the Burdock Route, now rapidly approaching Portandit. I took
      the liberty last night of attaching your car to this train, sir, instead
      of to your own Number Three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rockervelt sat up in alarm, glanced out of the windows, first on one side,
      then on the other. Bringing back his gaze to the man before him, hot anger
      added colour to the usual floridness of his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You took the liberty, did you? Well, let me tell you, sir, it is a
      liberty you will bitterly regret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hear you say that, sir,&rdquo; replied John humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The liberty! Curse it, sir! you have disarranged all my plans. There are
      three men in Tobasco whom it is imperative I should meet this forenoon
      before the convention opens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, sir. I had them telegraphed to take the Midnight and meet you
      at Portandit instead. They&rsquo;ll be waiting for you when you get in, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil you did!&rdquo; gasped Rockervelt, sinking back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, sir, it&rsquo;s an uneasy conference you would have had on that rocky
      road to Dublin, the T. and P. A long forenoon&rsquo;s ride, sir, with a line as
      rough as a rail fence. It would be like coming down the Soo Rapids, only
      you wouldn&rsquo;t travel so quickly. You are too good a railroad man, sir, not
      to hate a day journey, and I counted on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a minor matter, but you happen to be right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a carriage waiting for you, sir. You can drive to your hotel at
      your ease, hold the conference in your room, and drop in to the convention
      whenever it pleases you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you also arranged my return to New York, Mr. Steele? By what route
      do you intend to send me back?&rdquo; John laughed that cheerful, infectious
      laugh of his. He realised that the danger point was passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will get safe back to New York whatever route you take, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. How long have you been general manager of this road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two years, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you learn the business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the greatest railroad school of this world, sir&mdash;the Rockervelt
      System.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The faint shadow of a smile passed over the face of Mr. Rockervelt for the
      first time during the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I take as a handsome return for my testimonial to your road-bed. Why
      did you leave us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I failed to please Mr. Blair, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In whose department were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the division superintendent&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you please Philip Manson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I did, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um! Well, now, you did not waylay me for the purposes of pleasant
      conversation. I don&rsquo;t like to see good men leave us; and if your object in
      kidnapping me was to come back to us, I may at once admit I am willing to
      entertain a proposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. That was not my object, although I make bold to say that an
      offer from Mr. Rockervelt would exact respect from the greatest in the
      land, and I&rsquo;m no exception to my betters. What I wanted, sir, was to
      persuade you to cast your eye over this map. The red line represents
      sixty-three miles of level country, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; if a railway were built along that red line, your road would have
      access to New York independent of me. Well, young man, don&rsquo;t let that red
      line worry you. I could not allow you to get a charter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quick to see the possibilities, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but here are no probabilities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that, sir. Like the other fellow&rsquo;s fifteen dollars,
      I&rsquo;ve got the charter in my inside pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind showing it to me?&rdquo; asked Rockervelt, unconsciously finishing
      the line of the song referred to. John handed him the documents, and the
      great man scrutinised them with the quick care of an expert; then he
      folded them up again, but did not offer to return them. He gazed out upon
      the flying landscape for a few moments while Steele stood expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you overcome Blair&rsquo;s opposition?&rdquo; he inquired at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no opposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president frowned, and a glint of anger appeared in the cold,
      calculating eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect Blair to watch the Legislature as well as the railway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He watches neither, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rockervelt glanced sharply at the confident young man who thus dared to
      asperse one of the minor gods of the Rockervelt System.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who looks after the Midland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip Manson, and does it quietly and well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get the money to put this through? A syndicate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I didn&rsquo;t need any money. All I needed was that one of your general
      managers, should be sound asleep, and time to make personal friends of the
      members of the House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are prejudiced against Mr. Blair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rockervelt pulled himself together as one who has had enough of badinage
      and now prepares for business. His impassive face hardened, and the
      onlooker saw before him the man who had ruthlessly crushed opposition,
      regardless of consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, young man,&rdquo; he began, in a voice that cut like a knife, &ldquo;do you know
      the value of these documents?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Yes, sir; they&rsquo;re not worth a damn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Rockervelt, suddenly sitting bolt upright. &ldquo;I thought you
      had kidnapped me to hold me up, as is the genial Western fashion. Don&rsquo;t
      you want to sell this charter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I offered the charter to the Hon. Duffield Rogers, president of
      the Burdock, as was my duty, but he said you could beat any combination
      that might be formed in the long run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or in the short run. Sensible man, Rogers. Well, sir, you do not
      expect an exorbitant price for a worthless charter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want no price at all. The charter is yours. But I&rsquo;d like to offer you a
      hint as well as the charter, and the advice is to make Philip Manson
      manager of the Midland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; and what for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only bear me in mind when you have a vacancy for a well-paid official
      down east.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man had been standing during this long colloquy, but now Mr.
      Rockervelt asked him to be seated, and there being a suggestion of command
      as well as of request in his tone, John Steele, drew up a chair to the
      table that divided them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have quite definitely made up your mind, I take it, that T. Acton
      Blair is unfit for the position of general manager of the Manateau
      Midland,&rdquo; said the chief with quiet irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; replied Steele, defiantly, &ldquo;and so has everybody else who
      knows him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you admit the Midland is a well-managed road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, but that is because of Philip Manson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. &lsquo;The page slew the boar; the peer had the gloire,&rsquo; as the old
      poet said, and the peer, too, has the bigger salary, as a modern writer
      might remark. You never heard any reason given, I suppose, why Blair holds
      a better position than Manson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I did,&rdquo; cried the impetuous young man, &ldquo;it is said that Mr.
      Blair is a relative of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression of displeasure that clouded the face of the railway prince
      gave instant intimation to Steele that his reply had been tactless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine you have a great deal to learn, Mr. Steele, and I predict
      before you are as old as Mr. Blair you will receive some sharp lessons in
      diplomacy. You have shown yourself competent to smooth out the roughnesses
      that formerly characterised the Burdock route, but those same capabilities
      may not be equal to removing obstacles in your own path of life. The
      Midland is a well-managed road, and you say the credit belongs to Manson.
      Very good. I put Manson in his place, and so my purposes are fulfilled. If
      I made him general manager, as you suggest, he might or might not be a
      success, yet we are both agreed that he is a success in his present
      position. Now you, I see by this card, are general manager of the Burdock
      route. Does the Burdock, therefore, take a high place in the railway
      system of America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not,&rdquo; candidly admitted John Steele. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there is no money behind it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. My excellent friend, the Honorable Duffield Rogers, has plenty
      of money, but he knows enough to take care of it. He doesn&rsquo;t waste any of
      his wealth in trying to make the Burdock route all that his capable
      general manager may wish it to be. So you see, Mr. Steele, finance has to
      be considered as well as good road mending. In that department T. Acton
      Blair occupies a high position among the railway men of the West. If you
      ever accumulate a little money, and doubt my statement, venture your cash
      in a contest where Blair is your opponent, and, I venture to say, you&rsquo;ll
      regret it. On the other hand, if you should happen to become a friend of
      Mr. Blair, and he cared to give you a tip or two in higher finance, you
      may grow rich in following his lead. In this very matter of the charter
      there is a possibility that you have entirely underestimated the general
      manager of the Midland. It is on the cards that he agrees with you and me
      regarding the worthlessness of the charter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear he knew nothing about it,&rdquo; persisted Steele, knowing as soon
      as the sentence was uttered that again he had let his tongue run away with
      his judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he did, and perhaps he didn&rsquo;t. I strongly suspect he knew all
      about it, and hoped you would entangle old Rogers into a railway war, in
      which case I venture to assert, Blair would have crushed both you and your
      chief. Of course you tried to get Rogers to take up the struggle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he very politely, but quite definitely, refused?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That also is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, Mr. Steele,&rdquo; said Rockervelt, with something almost
      approaching a laugh, &ldquo;there is more wisdom in grey hairs than most young
      persons are willing to admit. Would you be surprised if I told you that I
      have determined to ignore your advice, and so will not remove Mr. Blair
      from his position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the least surprised, now that I know your opinion of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe then I can astonish you by admitting that I intend to remove your
      friend, Mr. Manson, from the situation he so worthily fills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To place him in a better position, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I have been in need of him for some time in our New York office.
      I should have taken him long ago, if I&rsquo;d had the right man to put in his
      place. The other day I received Philip Manson&rsquo;s resignation, and without
      either accepting or declining it, I telegraphed him to let me know whom he
      suggested as his substitute. Yesterday I received his reply, and although
      I have been unable to follow the advice you have tendered me so far, I may
      accept it regarding the new candidate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this Mr. Rockervelt pressed an electric button, and an alert young
      man answered his call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meldrum, bring me that last letter of Manson&rsquo;s about the division
      superintendency of the Midland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secretary returned a moment later with the document, which he handed
      to Rockervelt, who tossed it across the table towards Steele. The letter
      read:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Sir:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>In my opinion the best man to appoint as division superintendent of the
      Manateau Midland is John Steele, at present general manager of the Burdock
      route. He was formerly employed on the Midland in various capacities, and
      was promoted entirely through efficiency. Although the position he
      occupies on the Burdock is nominally higher than that left vacant by my
      resignation, yet I think Mr. Steele would be content with less honour and
      more money.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yours faithfully,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Philip Manson.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      As Steele looked up from the reading of this letter Rockervelt said
      sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> think you are the man referred to by Manson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather strange that you should have taken all the trouble to attach
      my car to your train when I had left word with Manson to get into
      communication with you, and arrange an interview between you and me at
      Portandit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was merely anticipating your wishes, Mr. Rockervelt. It is lucky I rang
      off Philip Manson last night so abruptly at the telephone, for I imagine
      this is what he was about to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much are they giving you on the Burdock route?&rdquo; asked Rockervelt
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of expressing his surprise at the smallness of the amount,
      Rockervelt merely said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you get your money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see to that,&rdquo; replied Steele with a laugh; &ldquo;I am general manager,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What salary do you want to take Philip Manson&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele cast down his eyes, and meditated in silence for a few
      moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would fifty dollars a week be too much?&rdquo; he asked in a tremor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a jump,&rdquo; said Rockervelt calmly, &ldquo;but I think the
      organisation can stand it, if it is satisfactory to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than satisfactory to me,&rdquo; replied Steele, earnestly. He was to
      learn later that modesty was its own reward. He could as easily have had
      double the money, and perhaps more. Multi-millionaire as he was, however,
      Rockervelt was not the man to throw away needless cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will take that as settled,&rdquo; he said, and this ended the interview.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;A CONSPIRACY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE greatest
      blessing that Providence can bestow upon a young man is self-knowledge.
      Success comes to those who know their own powers while it is yet day. To
      learn for the first time at eighty that you have immense capabilities in
      any given direction is futile. To possess that knowledge at twenty is
      better than to own a gold mine. It is the old adage exemplified: &ldquo;If age
      but could; if youth but knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele&rsquo;s two years&rsquo; management of the Burdock route should have given him
      confidence, but his bargain with Rockervelt showed it had not done so. If
      he had been shrewd enough to allow Rockervelt himself to name the
      compensation that should have gone with his new position, he would have
      made a much better financial deal than that which he accomplished. If he
      had then added a little shrewd bargaining, he might have bettered himself
      still further, but John Steele had endured an early life of poverty, and
      the salary he now received seemed to him munificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same qualities of under-estimation which caused Rockervelt to chuckle
      with satisfaction at a sharp bargain driven interfered with the young
      man&rsquo;s success as new division superintendent of the Midland. When he was
      duly installed, his immediate chief, T. Acton Blair, quaked. Blair was
      well acquainted with the ruthlessness of Rockervelt, and he trembled for
      his own position. He wondered how much Rockervelt knew. Was he aware of
      Blair&rsquo;s years of tyranny over the capable Philip Manson? Did he know how
      nearly the premier train of the road had come to being wrecked through the
      incompetence of a relative of his own, whom he had forced into the train
      despatched office in spite of the protests of Philip Manson? Now Manson
      was gone to New York, promoted to a position of greater power and
      influence than any he had hitherto held, and instead of Blair&rsquo;s being
      allowed to place some favourite in the vacant office, Rockervelt himself
      had intervened to appoint the very man who had saved the Pacific Express:
      a man whom Blair had practically dismissed two years before. If Blair
      possessed, as Rockervelt alleged, an acute brain in other directions than
      that of practical railway management, this brain was deeply perturbed when
      its owner, with over-done warmth, welcomed the new division superintendent
      of the Midland on his return to the great company. Innocent John Steele
      accepted this cordiality at its face value, and his own kind heart
      prompted him to let bygones be bygones, and to make the new condition of
      things as pleasant as possible for his nominal chief. At first this
      bewildered Blair; then he came to the conclusion it was merely deep craft
      on the part of the young man, and finally he reached the fact that Steele
      was quite honestly endeavouring to do his duty, and trying to please his
      superiors, a fact which a more alert mind would have assimilated months
      before. When, after weeks of doubt and fear, Blair at last realised that
      John Steele had in reality buried the tomahawk; that he had no knife
      concealed up his sleeve; that he was honest, straightforward and capable
      as his predecessor had been, the general manager felt like a man who had
      been taken advantage of. Instead of being thankful that his former fear
      was groundless, his resentment burned all the brighter, and he brought his
      genius for intrigue into play, determining to trip up the young man on the
      first favourable opportunity. But while he waited for that opportunity, he
      resumed the old tactics which had been so successful in pushing Philip
      Manson to a resignation, and proceeded to make John Steele&rsquo;s place as
      uncomfortable for him as possible. There is no tyranny like the tyranny of
      a coward, and before John Steele had been six months in his new position,
      he learned what it was to live under the heel of a despot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he enjoy the consolation which must have sustained Philip Manson,
      who possessed the enthusiastic loyalty of his subordinates. Manson was a
      born master, who had risen step by step into the position of division
      superintendent. Added to this, he was quiet, taciturn and unemotional.
      John Steele, on the other hand, was the embodiment of good-fellowship;
      talkative, humourous, genial; who believed every one around him as honest
      and whole-hearted as himself. But there were those beneath him who had
      regarded themselves quite properly in the line of promotion, and whose
      ambitions had been stirred when it became known that Philip Manson was
      about to retire. Then, to their chagrin and dismay, an outsider had been
      chosen for the place who, two years before, was little better than an
      office boy among them, and their friendliness for him at that time had
      been merely a tribute to his unfailing good nature; his willingness to
      help. This universal liking, however, was perhaps unconsciously tinged
      with contempt. Their feeling was rather admiration for a joyous soul than
      respect for a young fellow of talent. No one had an inkling of Steele&rsquo;s
      real merit except Philip Manson, and this silent man never volunteered
      information. When Blair wished Manson summarily to dismiss Steele, he got
      information he had not expected about the latter. When Rockervelt
      telegraphed regarding Manson&rsquo;s successor, he also received information,
      but Manson made no confidant of any of his subordinates, and perhaps if
      one of them had been shrewd enough to guess how good a man Steele was,
      that person might have been thought worthy of the recommendation which the
      former division superintendent had bestowed upon Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an insider is promoted, he not only steps into the vacant place, but
      the one beneath him advances to the position he formerly held, and so it
      goes down along the line, until the lowest grade is reached. Each man gets
      his little move upward, and universal joy is the result. But when an
      outsider is brought in, he stops the move as effectually as a jammed log
      arrests the progress of all the timber further up the stream. Although the
      genial John met smiling faces among his subordinates, there was
      nevertheless envy and hatred behind the smiles. Things began to go wrong;
      he could not give his orders explicitly enough to be sure that they would
      be understood. He met no open opposition, but the most annoying things
      happened in spite of all his precautions. A little harshness and injustice
      here would have acted as a tonic upon the whole clan. If he had flung out
      of the office the first man who misapprehended an order, whether that man
      were guilty or not, his path would have been smoother from that time
      forward; but here his own proneness to blame himself rather than to
      censure others was his worst enemy, and the office became honeycombed with
      negligence, apathy, incompetence and sullen insubordination. There was no
      sympathy to be expected from T. Acton Blair; in fact, the stout man saw
      with secret satisfaction that the division superintendent was not getting
      on. He would condole with Rockervelt on this regrettable failure next time
      he met him, instilling the poison very subtly, and assuming a tone of deep
      regret and disappointment. Meanwhile, his whole attitude towards the young
      man had changed. He was querulous and fault-finding; he magnified the
      failures, and slighted the successes. John Steele found himself between
      the upper and nether millstones that were grinding his nerves to rags. Day
      and night he worked like a Trojan to bring the necessary order out of the
      chaos that had somehow come to enshroud him, and underneath was the
      gnawing distrust of his own endowment properly to fill the place to which
      he had been appointed. He was working to the very limit of his powers, and
      preparing for himself an inevitable breakdown. He supplemented every one,
      instead of making every one supplement him. It never occurred to him that
      the chaos against which he contended was deliberate, for a railway
      business differs from any other on earth, in that carelessness or neglect
      is juggling with men&rsquo;s lives. A mistake comparatively innocent in any
      other branch of commercial activity may mean the massacre of a score of
      men and women on a railway. Many a night he sat disconsolate in his office
      when every one else had gone, and yearned for half an hour&rsquo;s talk with
      Philip Manson. The whole difficulty was not one which he could commit to
      writing, and even if he attempted that, he might fail in making Manson
      understand the situation; a situation so completely the reverse of that
      which had obtained during Manson&rsquo;s own reign. At last he determined to
      take a few days off, visit New York, and consult with his former chief.
      This brought about his first open conflict with T. Acton Blair, and then
      he weakly succumbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blair,&rdquo; he said one day, after the formal morning&rsquo;s interview was at
      an end, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take a run down to New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, are you?&rdquo; replied Blair. &ldquo;For what purpose, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to talk with Philip Manson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, about a great many things; about the general situation here, for
      instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Offhand, I should say I am the proper person to consult on such a
      subject,&rdquo; said Blair, with some acidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Steele, mildly, &ldquo;but you see, Man-son was my
      predecessor. He has probably been through what I am going through now, and
      I should like a few hints from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is to fill your place while you are away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnson could do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he is competent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite competent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then can you explain why Mr. Rockervelt put you in the place of Manson,
      if Johnson was capable of filling it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better ask that question of Mr. Rockervelt,&rdquo; suggested Steele,
      his temper rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall certainly do so if you leave your post. You are either necessary
      here or you are not. If you begin to suspect that you are not the man for
      the position, then you should resign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the man for the position, Mr. Blair; still, even the best of men,
      which I do not pretend to be, needs a little advice now and then, and I
      intend to seek it from Philip Manson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who knows his business neither seeks nor acts on advice. If you go
      to New York you go in spite of my prohibition, and I shall take your
      departure as an act of resignation, and proceed accordingly. I am either
      general manager of this road or I am not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now this latter phrase was one which Blair was exceedingly fond of using,
      and it had done duty several times during Philip Manson&rsquo;s <i>régime</i>,
      who had invariably shown Mr. Blair in exceedingly few words that, when it
      came to the point, he was not the autocrat he pretended to be. Manson
      would have made an excellent poker-player. He could have been beaten by
      better cards, but never by a bluff, and Blair&rsquo;s pet phrase was pure bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; said John Steele, rising and leaving the table, while his
      opponent raked in the chips. Steele did not know he had reached the climax
      where a determined answer would have given him the game, nor did he
      realise how disastrous was his defeat. A poltroon is a bad man to run away
      from.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Steele retreated to his own room, and a sweet smile overspread the
      chubby face of the corpulent man he had left victorious. A week later came
      the second encounter, which although it carried a second apparent defeat
      for John Steele, proved, nevertheless, to be the most important turning
      point of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The division superintendent entered the general manager&rsquo;s room with a
      telegram in his hand. Blair, looking up, noticed the agitation of his
      manner, and the paleness of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blair, I have just received a telegram which says that my uncle is
      dying. I wish to go to him, and intend to leave by to-night&rsquo;s train. He
      lives in the north of Michigan. I have therefore come to let you know that
      I shall be absent for a few days, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blair continued to gaze at him with a winning smile on his cherubic face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it not be a simpler matter, Mr. Steele, if you were to write to
      Philip Manson, and ask him to take a trip to his old home? You are a
      member of his club, I understand, and could quite readily hold your
      conference there if either of you did not care to discuss the state of
      affairs in this office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean, Mr. Blair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you do. The dying uncle device, or the funeral of a relative
      device, have all been tried upon me before. I am proof against such
      schemes, and really, Mr. Steele, I paid you the compliment of believing
      you to be more original.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am lying to you?&rdquo; asked John indignantly, taking a step
      nearer the general manager&rsquo;s table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t call it lying, Mr. Steele; we may term it diplomacy, or what you
      like. A week ago you requested leave of absence to consult Philip Manson.
      I refused my permission. Now you come to me with the story of a dying
      relative. I am bound to believe you, although I made a friendly suggestion
      a moment since which apparently you do not intend to accept, so we will
      get back to the original situation. Your uncle is very ill, and I am very
      sorry. There are doubtless at this moment many excellent persons in
      extremity, yet nevertheless the trains of the Midland must run, and even
      if Mr. Rock-ervelt or myself were removed to a better land, not a wheel
      would cease turning on our account. Therefore, hoping you will accept the
      expression of my deep sympathy, which I hereby tender to you, I must
      nevertheless refuse to allow the office of division superintendent to
      remain vacant for one hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is the only relative I have in the world,&rdquo; protested John,
      earnestly. &ldquo;Here is the telegram I have received. Read it for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blair, still smiling, waved his stout hand gently to and fro, but
      refused even to glance at the paper laid before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not doubt in the least that the despatch comes from Michigan. I can
      even guess that it is worded in the most urgent terms, and that the
      signature is perfectly genuine. Nevertheless, Mr. Steele, it is better we
      should understand each other. As I told you a week ago, if you leave your
      position without my permission you will find that position permanently
      filled on your return. This is a free country, and you are entitled to go
      or stay as you please. If you hand me in your resignation, as your
      predecessor did, I shall say to you as I said to him, &lsquo;Go, and prosperity
      be with you,&rsquo; but while you are a member of my staff, you are under my
      orders. Do I make myself sufficiently plain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do,&rdquo; replied John Steele, picking up his telegram and leaving
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more at his own desk he sat there for a long time with his head in
      his hands. At first it was his determination to resign forthwith. The
      situation was growing as intolerable for him as it had been for his
      predecessor, but the longer he thought over what had happened the more he
      realised the impossibility of surrender. If he resigned now, he left the
      Rockervelt system a failure. He would be compelled to begin at the foot of
      the ladder again, handicapped by practical dismissal; to strive as an
      unsuccessful man, his years of experience counting for nothing. But even
      if that consideration did not harden his resolution to remain where he
      was, the thought of his uncle would alone have been sufficient to turn the
      balance. Bitterly he accused himself of his neglect of the old man who, as
      he had just said, was his only relative on earth. While he was escaping
      from the hopeless poverty in which they had both lived, the struggle for
      existence had become so interesting that it had obliterated the fact that
      Dugald Steele was still where he had left him, and not a penny of money
      had the young man ever forwarded to him. Up to the time his salary was
      made fifty dollars a week he had not only saved no money but had run into
      debt. These obligations were now liquidated, and he had a few hundreds in
      the bank; the nucleus, he hoped, of more to follow. The old man had
      brought him up, after a fashion, allowing him to go to school during the
      winter months, but every waking hour the uncle forced the nephew to work
      almost beyond the limit of his youthful powers, and at last had driven him
      forth with blows and cursings during one of those periodical fits of
      temper which had made Dugald Steele a terror to the neighbourhood. One
      letter, indeed, John had written to his old home, when he got his
      situation at Hitchen&rsquo;s Siding, but that had remained unanswered, and he
      had taken it for granted that his uncle&rsquo;s anger was permanent.
      Nevertheless, the telegram showed that the uncle had kept the letter, or
      remembered the address, for the despatch had been sent to Hitchen&rsquo;s
      Siding, and from there forwarded to John Steele&rsquo;s office in Warmington.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was little profit in bemoaning a state of things he could
      not remedy. It was certain that Blair would carry out his threat, if
      Steele left his place without permission, so there was nothing for it but
      to sit tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a deep sigh the young man pulled himself together, drew toward him a
      sheet of paper and wrote a letter that proved to be more important than
      its wording would have led a casual reader to suspect.

      CHAPTER V&mdash;A FAVOURITE OF FORTUNE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>UGALD STEELE
      cordially hated his neighbours, and evinced little hesitation in telling
      them so, whenever opportunity offered. He lived apparently in the depths
      of extreme poverty, occupying a dilapidated wooden, unpainted house at the
      northern outskirts of the village of Stumpville, Michigan. He kept no
      servant, but cooked his own meals, and if any trespassers dared to set
      foot on his property, he threatened them with a shotgun. He was a
      cantankerous, crabbed old Scotsman, snarling like an unowned dog, and
      going about in shabbier clothes than the most ragged tramp that had ever
      honoured Stumpville with his fleeting presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dugald and his younger brother Neil, the latter then newly married, came
      out of the highlands of Scotland to the lowlands of Michigan. It was not
      that the life in the American backwoods was harder than life in the
      northern part of Scotland, but the hardships were different, and they
      affected the health of the young wife; she died because of a falling tree&mdash;a
      tree she had never seen, and whose final crash she had not heard. Her
      husband was felling oaks in the forest, and one of them lodged in the
      branches of another, resting there at an angle of forty-five degrees.
      Neil, unaccustomed to forestry in its gigantic American form, not knowing
      the danger he ran, set himself to chop down the impediment, when the
      half-fallen tree suddenly completed its descent and crushed him, face
      downward and lifeless, into the forest mould. To the elder brother fell
      the grim task of chopping through the fallen timber and rolling the log
      from off the dead man. The wife died from the shock, and their little boy
      was left to the care of his taciturn uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one is alive who knew Dugald Steele in his youth, and so none can tell
      what early experiences may have warped his character. Perhaps the stinging
      poverty of those days gave him an exaggerated idea of the necessity of
      hoarding money; perhaps the tragic death of his brother, whose rude coffin
      he made with his own hands from slabs of the tree that killed him, crushed
      out his natural affections instead of ripening them; but, be that as it
      may, he was, during the latter part of his life, a hard man, whom no tale
      of pathos could move into the expenditure of a penny; a gnarled,
      cross-grained, twisted specimen of humanity from whom all emotion, except
      that of hatred, seemed to have departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he died a will was found leaving all his property to a neighbouring
      town simply, as he said in the document, written by his own hand to save a
      lawyer&rsquo;s fee, that he might wreak posthumous revenge upon his neighbours,
      who would understand, now that it was too late, what they had missed by
      not being decent to him. But this will was invalidated by a later one,
      which shows how a man with a kind heart may sometimes do well for himself
      when he little understands what he is about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nemesis comes to all of us, and it is strange that it should have rested
      on old Dugald, as the result of the hard, honest work in his young days.
      Seeing no smoke from his chimney, a kindly woman neighbour, with fear and
      trembling, penetrated to his dwelling, and found him knotted on the floor
      with rheumatism, snarling and waspish as ever, but helpless. The woman ran
      for assistance, and he was lifted into his bed, where he lay when the
      doctor came, while the old man protested that he had no money to pay him,
      and would not pay him if he had. The doctor, however, did the best he
      could for him, and told the neighbours that the old man was stricken with
      his last illness, which indeed proved to be the case. The doctor said to
      his patient that if he had any relatives he wished to see he had better
      send for them, offering to write if the old man gave him an address. All
      his life Dugald Steele had distrusted medical advice, but it is likely
      that on this occasion something within him corroborated the verdict which
      had been passed upon him. He lay there for a long time in silence, the
      doctor waiting, and at last said, in a hoarse whisper, that he would like
      his nephew to know he was ill, giving the address as John Steele,
      Hitchen&rsquo;s Siding; but, he added, with a return of his cantankerousness,
      that the doctor was to tell his nephew he need not come unless he wanted
      to. The doctor at his own cost sent a telegram, and late that night
      received a long answering despatch from John Steele which deplored the
      impossibility of the sender&rsquo;s going to Stumpville at that time, begged
      that no expense should be spared in getting the old man what comforts he
      needed, and concluded by saying that a check for a hundred dollars had
      been posted to the physician for the purpose indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man knew his uncle well enough to be aware that if he sent the
      money direct to him, that miserly person would hoard it, rather than spend
      a penny on whatever necessities he required. He also knew the delight his
      uncle experienced in handling money, so when he sent the letter he
      enclosed two crisp new ten-dollar bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>My Dear Uncle,&mdash;he wrote,&mdash;I am deeply grieved to hear from
      the doctor of your illness and sincerely hope it is not serious. I would
      come to you at once if I could, but, alas, there is over me a severe
      taskmaster who refuses me even a day&rsquo;s leave, yet my position here is so
      good that I dare not jeopardise it by absenting myself without permission,
      for if I lose my job I lose also the chance of assisting you. Please
      accept the twenty dollars which I send you, and get for yourself whatever
      you may need. Procure the best physician in the place, and a nurse. I will
      send you more money right along, and if it is not enough, refer creditors
      to my employers, and they will, I think, guarantee that I can pay any debt
      you may incur. Please do not stint yourself, but order what you want, or
      whatever the physician thinks you should have, and do not imagine that the
      spending of money will leave me short, for I have several hundred dollars
      in a bank, and will send it to you as you require it. So, dear uncle, keep
      up a good heart and take every care of yourself.&mdash;Your loving Nephew.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman sitting at the bed-head read this letter to the old man,
      wondering if he was paying attention, for his eyes were closed. Presently
      she saw a tear trickle down his withered cheek and she thought his heart
      was softening, but the first remark he made did not seem to verify that
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the money,&rdquo; he demanded in a harsh whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bills were handed to him, and his long, yellow fingers, like talons,
      closed avariciously upon them; lingeringly dwelling on their smooth
      texture, thumb and finger rubbed them up and down. His next remark was
      more encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read the letter again,&rdquo; he said, and the woman did so, although anger was
      in her heart that affection should be wasted upon one so unworthy. There
      was a long silence after she had finished the second reading, and at last
      she asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I send for another doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; growled the old man, &ldquo;doctors can do me no good. Go and tell Lawyer
      Strathmore I want to see him. Tell him I have just received twenty
      dollars, else he won&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer came on the strength of the woman&rsquo;s assurance that the money
      had arrived, and on his return to his office his partner said: &ldquo;Well, what
      struck the old Highlander? Wanted to make his will, I suppose. I hope he
      hasn&rsquo;t left his ancient suit of clothes to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s gone clean crazy,&rdquo; replied Strathmore, &ldquo;but I secured ten
      dollars all right enough, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter. He seems to think he owns
      Michigan. Two hundred thousand dollars Michigan Central Railway stock are
      deposited in the vaults of the Wayne County Savings Bank. Seventy-nine
      thousand dollars Northern Pacific stock deposited somewhere else. Cash in
      the bank over thirty thousand dollars&mdash;amounting all in all to
      something like three hundred thousand dollars, which is left to a nephew
      of his, a railway man on the Manateau Midland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, Strathmore,&rdquo; cried the partner, who had been a newspaper man in
      his youth and saw a sensation in this, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t take my oath that it
      isn&rsquo;t all right. He&rsquo;s just the sort of a dilapidated old miser who would
      turn out to be a rich man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said Strathmore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Improbable, perhaps, but a telegram to Detroit would soon let us know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it did let them know. The inhabitants of Stumpville learned next
      morning that an old man had died in one of their most ruinous shanties who
      could have bought and sold each of them, and all of them combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the telegram came announcing his uncle&rsquo;s death John Steele rose from
      his desk, locked the door, and paced up and down the room with bent head.
      He had not expected this outcome, for although his uncle was old, he had
      weathered so many gales, it had not occurred to the young man that there
      must come one storm which would lay the gnarled old oak level with the
      ground. Unavailingly did he regret that a consideration for his own
      position had kept him from the bedside. With a sigh he stopped his walk,
      pulled himself together, sat down at his desk, and wrote a brief note to
      Blair, saying he had just received a telegram informing him of the death
      of his uncle; that he intended to start by the next train for Michigan,
      and would put Johnson temporarily in his place. He might be gone as long
      as three days, but anything addressed to Stumpville would find him.
      Pinning the telegram to this, and folding up the documents, he sealed them
      into an envelope addressed to T. Acton Blair, and sent the letter by a
      messenger to the general manager&rsquo;s room. He knew that official was in his
      office, but until the time John took his train there came no response to
      his note. He called in Johnson, and briefly placed him in transient
      command. The young man received his appointment with a smug satisfaction
      that he found it impossible quite to conceal, and although his departing
      chief noticed this, he made no comment upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his journey to Stumpville John Steele meditated upon his plan of
      campaign. The sense of injustice he had felt ever since Blair refused him
      permission to visit his uncle was now crystallised into a determination to
      use the iron gauntlet rather than the velvet glove in future. Naturally he
      was of a conciliatory disposition, but the exercise of forbearance had
      resulted in failure and disorganisation. The next move lay with the
      general manager. If Blair persisted in dismissing him, he would appeal to
      Cæsar, for Cæsar himself had placed him in the position he held.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at Stumpville, he went direct to the telegraph office, and found
      awaiting him a despatch which, he was well aware without opening it, came
      from the general manager; no one else knew his address. The fact that he
      telegraphed instead of sending a messenger to his room in the same
      building, which he had had ample time to do, seemed to Steele the first
      sign of weakness. Blair wished to settle this matter at long range.
      Tearing open the envelope he read: &ldquo;I am amazed that you should have left
      your post without at least personal consultation with me. I have made your
      appointment of Johnson permanent, but will hold his former office open for
      you unless you decline to accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele smiled grimly as he read these words. They showed that Blair had
      not the courage definitely to dismiss him. The general manager was afraid
      to burn his bridges behind him, hoping possibly that Steele would
      telegraph his resignation or his indignant refusal of the subordinate
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving the city, John Steele had withdrawn from the bank several
      hundred dollars in order that he might pay any debts his uncle had
      contracted, and in order also that his funeral should be as imposing as if
      the old man had been the leading citizen of the place. Then to his
      amazement he learned that Dugald Steele had made him comparatively a rich
      man, but this independence made no difference in Steele&rsquo;s projects for the
      future. He liked work for its own sake, and he was particularly attached
      to the duty which chance and good fortune had assigned to him. He was not
      going to allow that task to be interfered with by a pompous wind-bag like
      T. Acton Blair, and much less so by a gang of undisciplined subordinates
      who needed to hear the crack of the whip over their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the journey back to the city, however, a germ of thought formed in his
      mind, for the present to lie dormant, but in the future to develop into
      marvellous things, watered by circumstance, fertilised by disaster.
      Pondering on the strange, almost repulsive character of the old miser who
      was gone, it occurred to John Steele that mere hoarding could never have
      produced the sum of money he had accumulated. In his uncle&rsquo;s mental
      equipment there must have been a shrewd understanding of the world&rsquo;s
      affairs, of which he secretly took advantage to his own enrichment. Quite
      unsuspected by his neighbours this recluse had played a game of finance
      that proved marvellously successful. This could not have been done in
      Stumpville. Dugald Steele had evidently worked through a broker in some
      large city, and John Steele began to wonder if he, too, had inherited this
      seventh sense of money-making which has produced those bulky unearned
      fortunes for which America is celebrated or notorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      John resolved to watch the markets in future and learn some of the rules
      of the game; then he would venture in a small way, so that it did not
      matter whether he won or lost, and thus put his suspected hereditary
      abilities to the test. He was very sure from what he remembered of his
      uncle that the cautious old man had never plunged blindly into
      speculation. Unless he was very much mistaken, there had been nothing of
      the gambler about Dugald Steele. He surely amassed his wealth because of a
      well-informed belief in the continued progress of his adopted country,
      placing his money here and there where he believed it would secure the
      advantage of a rise in values. Thus the glow lamp of sweet reasonableness
      shed its mild rays upon the entrance of a path new to John Steele; a path
      which offered alluring vistas, but led into a wild and dangerous country&mdash;the
      path of speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Steele opened the door of the division superintendent&rsquo;s room,
      Johnson, seated in the division superintendent&rsquo;s chair, whirled round
      abruptly with the frown of high authority on his brow, apparently annoyed
      that any one should have taken the liberty of entering without knocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Steele, it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo; cried Johnson airily, neglecting to prefix
      the word &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; which he would have used a week before. &ldquo;How-d&rsquo;e-do,
      how-d&rsquo;e-do? When did you get back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My train arrived just three minutes ago,&rdquo; replied John Steele calmly. He
      closed the door behind him, and stood there, while Johnson remained
      seated, palpably uneasy, evidently determined to carry off the situation
      with an air of bonhomie. Mentally he had no doubt rehearsed it several
      times during the past few days, but the man now confronting him was not
      the anxious, worried individual who had left the chair he continued to sit
      in, or the genial, good-humoured youth of former years. For the first time
      in their intercourse Johnson saw before him the stern demeanour of one in
      authority, and inwardly he quaked, though outwardly he endeavoured to
      maintain the guise of airy indifference which appeared fitting for the
      encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You received Mr. Blair&rsquo;s telegram, I suppose?&rdquo; said Johnson at last,
      becoming more and more embarrassed by the frigid silence. Somehow the
      crisis was not evolving exactly as he had pictured it. He was <i>de facto</i>
      division superintendent, yet somehow this new, quiet man before him did
      not appear to recognise his elevation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything has gone right since I left, I take it; otherwise I should
      have heard from you,&rdquo; remarked Steele, ignoring the question just put to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;everything has gone smoothly. Look here,
      Steele,&rdquo; cried Johnson in a burst of candour, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you reply to the
      old man&rsquo;s telegram? You know how touchy he is on questions of discipline.
      He very generously offered you the position I held, and you didn&rsquo;t even
      take the trouble to acknowledge his kindness. I can assure you, John, it
      has been all I could do to keep the old man from promoting Car-ruthers
      into my place, but I succeeded in persuading Mr. Blair to take no further
      steps until you returned. I said I was sure you would have some
      satisfactory explanation to offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were quite right; I have. And now, Mr. Johnson, you will reap the
      reward of your own kindness. The place you have so generously kept open
      for me I take pleasure in bestowing upon you; but in return for the
      counsel you have been good enough to give me, I warn you that unless I get
      a little better service than has been rendered for some months past you
      will not hold the position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnson threw back his head and laughed loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steele, my dear boy, that&rsquo;s a good bluff, but it won&rsquo;t work. I have been
      made division superintendent by the general manager of this road. Mr.
      Blair and myself have both been very patient over your unauthorised
      desertion of your post, but I tell you frankly that my patience is at an
      end. I offer you the position which I formerly held. If you do not at once
      accept it, I shall call Car-ruthers in and give him the vacant place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said John Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson&rsquo;s hand hovered over the electric button, but he forbore to press
      it, looking anxiously toward the impassive man who had made such a curt
      reply to his threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dislike exceedingly to call Carruthers. I want to give you every
      chance, Steele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very good of you, but don&rsquo;t hesitate on my account. I may say,
      however, that if you touch that button, or issue any further orders in
      this room, you will automatically have dismissed yourself from the service
      of the Midland Road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it, is it? You&rsquo;re going to show fight, are you? I&rsquo;ll very
      quickly convince you that you haven&rsquo;t the slightest chance of winning. I
      have behind me the general manager of this road, and he has the owners of
      the system behind <i>him</i>. If you bring on an unnecessary contest, in
      which you have no possibility of victory, I shall then not allow you to be
      employed on this line, even in the meanest capacity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite understand, Mr. Johnson, that either you or I must leave. Now,
      press the button, and make your promotion without further talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this time Johnson&rsquo;s hand had been hesitating over the ivory knob. It
      trembled slightly, but at last it took the plunge, and made the signal.
      Presently there came a knock at the door, and James Carruthers entered,
      glancing uncertainly from Steele to Johnson, apparently undecided whom he
      should first address. Johnson&rsquo;s voice was extremely urbane, and it brought
      joy to the heart of his former colleague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carruthers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will now take my place in the other room, and
      with your new position I am happy to say there will be an addition to your
      salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; replied Carruthers, very humbly, meanwhile
      glancing timidly at the silent man standing there. Perhaps James
      Carruthers would have been more certain of his promotion had John Steele
      made the announcement. The latter&rsquo;s kind heart was not proof against this
      mute appeal, and a smile came to his lips as he said: &ldquo;Have no fear,
      Carruthers. It gives me great pleasure to sanction your appointment. Now,
      just step around to Mr. Blair&rsquo;s room, and ask him to come here for a
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do nothing of the sort, Carruthers,&rdquo; cried Johnson truculently,
      springing to his feet with clenched fist. It was neck or nothing now, and
      he knew it. &ldquo;I am division superintendent, and in this room you take
      orders from no one but me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Carruthers stood with his hand on the door knob, wishing himself
      safely back in his own room, while Johnson took a determined step toward
      him, seeing the youth&rsquo;s hesitation, and resolved to overcome it in his own
      favour. Then a quite unimportant incident happened which caused him to
      face the other way, and to feel that somehow he had lost a point in the
      game. Without any hurry John Steele had seated himself in the division
      superintendent&rsquo;s chair. Steele, momentarily ignoring both commander and
      commanded, rang a bell at the private telephone which communicated with
      the general manager&rsquo;s room, and placed the receiver at his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Mr. Blair? This is John Steele. I have just returned, and I
      want you to step round to my room, as I wish to make a rather important
      communication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a momentary pause, and so intensely still did the room become
      that the two men standing there looking at John Steele could hear the
      indefinite murmur of the voice coming over the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Steele firmly, &ldquo;the conference must take place in this room,
      and it must take place now. Otherwise the complaint I have to make against
      you will go by telegraph direct to Mr. Rockervelt, and I shall leave by
      to-night&rsquo;s train for New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a pause, and a ghostly suggestion of a whisper. Then
      Steele said: &ldquo;Oh, I am not on the war-path at all. In fact, such is my
      deep respect for yourself that it rests entirely with you to say whether
      there will <i>be</i> a war-path or not. Personally I see no necessity for
      it. Just step round, and we&rsquo;ll talk it over in the most amicable way. Yes,
      Johnson&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; With that Steele hung up his receiver, swung round on the
      swivel chair, the usual winning smile on his lips as he met the gaze of
      two very anxious young men. His voice, however, was sharp enough when he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carruthers, clear out,&rdquo; whereupon Carruthers opened the door and
      disappeared as if by magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnson, sit down. You are just about to learn a lesson on the value of
      all this backing of which you have been boasting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Johnson could either accede to the request or disobey it the door
      opened and the stout gentleman entered. There was a severe frown on his
      brow intended to denote resolute strength, but an expression of
      uncertainty in his lower face which hinted at weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steele waved his hand amiably toward a deep leather-covered easy chair,
      and into its luxurious folds the fat man sank, drawing forth a
      handkerchief, which he passed across his brow, and somehow the action
      appeared to obliterate the frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said in your telegram, Mr. Blair, that I was in fault because I left
      without personally consulting with you, but I think you will forgive my
      error when you remember that having applied for permission to leave when
      my uncle was dying, and being refused, it would have been futile for me to
      appear before you with proof of his death and a further request for leave
      of absence. You would have been bound in consistency to refuse, while I
      was equally determined to attend my uncle&rsquo;s funeral. If you disbelieved my
      words when I told you he was dying, you could not have so stultified
      yourself as to credit the news of his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not disbelieve your word,&rdquo; protested Blair, timorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood you to do so. If you did not, then your action was at once
      cruel and tyrannical. However, that is past and done with, so we will say
      no more about it, unless you choose that it should come up later on. Now,
      I may inform you that my late uncle has left me a legacy that approximates
      three hundred thousand dollars. As the interest on this, even at one per
      cent, is more than I receive as division superintendent of the Midland,
      you will easily understand that I do not retain my position merely from
      mercenary motives. I am to-day in a position of independence which makes
      the outcome of any struggle we may engage in a matter of perfect
      indifference to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy,&rdquo; said Blair, again mopping his brow, &ldquo;to be the first of your
      old colleagues to congratulate you on your improved prospects. John Jacob
      Astor once said that a poor man with a hundred thousand dollars might make
      a fortune in this country. Although times have changed since then, still,
      a poor man with three times that amount has numerous opportunities denied
      to more poverty-stricken individuals. As for the struggle you speak of, I
      really see nothing on earth that either of us would gain by engaging in
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> am quite at one with you there, sir, and indeed you will find me
      the least belligerent of individuals if I but get my own way, which I
      intend to insist on hereafter, so far as my immediate department is
      concerned. While I have no fear of the struggle I suggested, neither have
      I any desire to engage in it. You see, Mr. Blair, you would be too
      severely handicapped from the start to give you a chance. Your task would
      be to show that Mr. Rockervelt is a fool, while all I should need to do
      would be to prove that he is the wisest of men. You are too shrewd a judge
      of human nature to doubt the outcome of such a contest. Mr. Rockervelt
      prides himself on two things. First, the unerringness of his judgment
      regarding men; second, the excellence of his various roads, and he reaches
      the second by means of the first. Now, he placed me in this chair. If he
      had wished you to choose the occupant, he would have delegated that duty
      to you. If he had desired the estimable Mr. Johnson here, he would not
      have had the slightest hesitation in enlisting Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s co-operation.
      Now, if you stood to gain anything by forcing a hopeless issue I could
      comprehend your attitude, but anything you wish you can have through good
      will, so where is the use of coercion or of a fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, my dear Mr. Steele, that I have no desire whatever to bring
      on a fight. I have said so all along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Blair, there&rsquo;s no more to be said, and I predict you will
      find me the most deferential, accommodating subordinate that ever worked
      in your office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where do I come in?&rdquo; ejaculated the panic-stricken Johnson, whose
      face had become paler and paler as this colloquy went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> come in,&rdquo; said John Steele urbanely. &ldquo;I
      told you that at the beginning, when I counselled you not to enter a
      contest where you were bound to be the loser. I commend to you in future
      the sensible attitude assumed by Mr. Blair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blair,&rdquo; persisted Johnson, &ldquo;you appointed me division superintendent,
      and assured me you would stand by that appointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; explained Blair, &ldquo;you see how it is yourself. I did so under
      an entire misapprehension. I thought that Mr. Steele had openly defied my
      authority, which I now understand was not the case. Am I right in that,
      Mr. Steele?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly right, sir. I had no desire to impugn your authority, and I
      apologise for my abrupt action, which certainly bore that complexion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Johnson,&rdquo; said Blair, almost pleadingly, &ldquo;you must see that puts a
      different face on the matter entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It certainly put a different face on Johnson, who stood there with dropped
      jaw, gazing pitifully at his backboneless chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry there has been any misunderstanding,&rdquo; said Blair
      soothingly. &ldquo;Such, of course, occurs in all offices, but luckily
      discipline is so perfect here that a few words will adjust things in their
      right proportion to each other. You have done very well, Mr. Johnson,
      during your short occupancy of this room, and when you resume your old
      place you may be certain that both Mr. Steele and myself will remember you
      when a chance for promotion occurs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret to say,&rdquo; remarked Steele casually, before Johnson had an
      opportunity of speaking, &ldquo;that Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s last act during his temporary
      occupancy of this chair was to promote Carruthers into his vacant place,
      and this promotion I myself confirmed. I recommend Mr. Johnson to take a
      vacation for a month, and if during that period he secures another
      situation, I shall be happy to recommend him, and probably you, Mr. Blair,
      would not object to do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, certainly not,&rdquo; muttered Blair hastily. &ldquo;If, at the end of
      a month,&rdquo; continued John Steele, &ldquo;you have not suited yourself, Mr.
      Johnson, you may return to me, and I&rsquo;ll see what I can do for you. I am
      going to rearrange my staff, and give most of its members a step upward.
      Some of them, however, will take a step downward, and some will be
      promoted over the heads of their seniors. All this will require a little
      thought and manipulation, but, as Mr. Blair truly says, discipline is
      everything, and I am determined to carry out his wishes in that respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Steele,&rdquo; said the general manager, rising with a deep sigh of
      satisfaction, as if everything had gone exactly as he planned it,
      &ldquo;anything I can do to help on the good work will not be stinted. Call upon
      me when in any difficulty, Mr. Steele, and be assured of my most
      whole-hearted support,&rdquo; and with that the great man held out his hand,
      which Steele, springing to his feet, clasped cordially. Without a glance
      at the crest-fallen Johnson, T. Acton Blair strode majestically from the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Steele turned to his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have a word with you, Mr. Steele?&rdquo; asked Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this day month,&rdquo; said John Steele without looking up.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;&ldquo;THERE&rsquo;S NOTHING HALF SO SWEET IN LIFE&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>OHN STEELE now
      entered upon a period of his life which was most interesting and
      enjoyable. The numerous petty and annoying incidents which had heretofore
      been the cause of friction between himself and his numerous subordinates
      disappeared as the mist fades before the rising sun, and he found himself
      at the head of as willing and energetic a staff as any man could wish to
      have co-operate with him. With his chief even the most captious of men
      could have no fault to find, and Steele was far from being captious. T.
      Acton Blair seemed a changed man. No one could be more genial and
      considerate. He even drifted into the habit of calling his division
      superintendent &ldquo;John.&rdquo; Their business conferences were of an exceedingly
      friendly and amiable character, and yet John frequently censured himself
      when he detected deep down in his own nature remnants of distrust still
      lingering regarding his urbane superior. Once when Blair was gone rather
      longer than usual on a visit to New York, some inquiries that came through
      caused him to surmise that Blair was undermining him at headquarters, but
      on Blair&rsquo;s return John felt rather ashamed of himself. That good man had
      indeed mentioned him to the powers that be, but the mention had been
      entirely to his advantage, with the result that John got ten dollars a
      week added to his salary, quite unsolicited. Blair almost apologised for
      his action, saying by way of excuse that the road was really getting so
      prosperous, and had been so free from disaster ever since Steele had
      joined it, that Rockervelt was pluming himself on having chosen the right
      man once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Blair casually, &ldquo;Mr. Rockervelt informed me he had read
      in the newspapers of your windfall. He asked me in what your money was
      invested, but I was unable to tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of it is in railway stocks,&rdquo; replied Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that would have interested him. Are any of the Rockervelt stocks in
      your safe deposit vault?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I possess a single share, even in the Manateau Midland.
      Perhaps it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to make a transfer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Blair, impartially. &ldquo;Unless a man is a
      professional speculator he generally loses in transferring his stock from
      one interest to another. The broker usually gets a slice when this
      happens. Still, I am sure Mr. Rockervelt would be rather pleased to hear
      that you own stock in the Midland. He encourages that sort of thing,
      especially among his higher officials, imagining quite rightly, perhaps,
      that they are just a leetle more careful if they are part owners of the
      road they operate. I think it&rsquo;s a very good idea, myself; still, at the
      present moment all the Rockervelt lines are booming, and I don&rsquo;t know any
      investment I could more cordially recommend. Still, I&rsquo;m prejudiced in the
      matter, so don&rsquo;t let what I say influence you in the least. But if you
      should buy a block of Midland, for instance, I wish you&rsquo;d let me know, so
      that when I am next in New York I can answer Mr. Rockervelt&rsquo;s former
      question. It certainly wouldn&rsquo;t do you any harm with Rockervelt, and
      there&rsquo;s no better security on the market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The newspapers had made much of John Steele&rsquo;s luck in falling heir to a
      considerable sum of money. The circumstances and unexpected nature of the
      legacy gave the item a semi-sensational value which was not neglected by
      the reporters, and even if the amount was in many cases exaggerated, the
      reputation of being a wealthy man revealed an entirely new world to the
      young superintendent&mdash;the world of social life. He was taken up by
      society with a warmth that was peculiarly gratifying to so modest a man as
      John Steele, and for this taking-up T. Acton Blair was largely
      responsible. On two or three occasions he invited John to dinner, where
      the young man met many delightful people. He now saw a side of Blair that
      had heretofore been entirely hidden from him, and, in spite of
      Rockervelt&rsquo;s former warning, quite unsuspected. Blair as a host was one of
      the most charming of men; debonair and polite as a Frenchman; a very
      prince of good fellows. His house was a veritable palace, and when first
      John was ushered into the midst of its magnificence, it seemed scarcely
      credible that a young nobody like himself, but a few years past occupying
      a miserable position on the railway in the prairies, should actually have
      browbeaten and defeated the owner of all this wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blair evinced no rancour over this defeat, and Steele esteemed him a human
      nettle, dangerous only when timorously handled. Steele was too shrewd a
      man not to have recognised that he had discovered the weak spot in Blairs
      armour, which was a fixed aversion against being brought into conflict of
      any kind with the great Rockervelt, and this knowledge gave the young man
      assurance that his position on the staff of the gigantic corporation was
      more stable than he had hitherto regarded it. He now saw Blair as a
      genial, easy-going man, who always took the line of the least resistance,
      avoiding unnecessary trouble, which was wise in one-so well to do in the
      world&rsquo;s goods, and as John himself was imbued with the most kindly
      feelings toward even his enemies, he had the gratification now of
      beholding his future extend before him like a well-ordered railway line: a
      clear right-of-way, and no signals against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning Mr. Blair entered the division superintendent&rsquo;s room,
      accompanied by a man so much like himself that he might almost be taken
      for his younger brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Steele,&rdquo; cried the general manager, in his most amiable manner, &ldquo;I
      wish to introduce you to Colonel Beck, an officer of the company, who
      keeps us all out of prison. Colonel Beck is Mr. Rockervelt&rsquo;s chief legal
      adviser, who knows so much about the law that he can enable any one with
      money to evade it. Colonel Beck, this is Mr. John Steele, our youngest,
      and I believe I may add, our most capable division superintendent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel laughed pleasantly as he shook hands with the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blair gives you a better character than he bestows upon me,&rdquo; said the
      lawyer, with a good-natured twinkle of the eye. &ldquo;If there is one
      characteristic more distinctive than another in the Rockervelt system, it
      is the unvarying respect it holds for the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; rejoined Blair. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we respect the
      laws when the Colonel here makes most of them pertaining to railways?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you then a member of the Legislature?&rdquo; asked John innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of the fat men laughed, and Colonel Beck replied: &ldquo;No, I am not so
      restricted as all that. A member of the Legislature possesses one vote. In
      the secret sanctity of this room, now that my friend Blair has given a
      hint in that direction, I may say I control many votes in the various
      Legislatures, and perhaps a few in the National Capitol as well. Still,
      that&rsquo;s all among ourselves, Mr. Steele, and, getting to safer ground, I
      may add that I esteem this meeting a pleasure, for you are one of the few
      men I have heard Mr. Rockervelt speak highly of, and when Mr. Rockervelt
      praises a man I like to know that man and make him my friend if possible,
      for he is sure to go far. I think,&rdquo; continued the Colonel, turning toward
      Blair, &ldquo;that Mr. Rockervelt said the superintendent here was rather a
      considerable shareholder in the Midland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Rockervelt was a trifle premature if he said that,&rdquo; replied the
      general manager. &ldquo;He spoke to me about it last time I was in New York, but
      I was unable at the time to give him definite information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not in the least premature,&rdquo; Steele intervened quietly. &ldquo;Since our
      conversation a while ago, Mr. Blair, I have sold out all my Michigan
      Central Stock with some of my Northern Pacific, and have invested in
      Manateau Midland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then you are one of us,&rdquo; cried Beck, with enthusiasm; &ldquo;I wish I had
      known you before you made the transfer, because I could have introduced
      you to brokers who would have done the job at the same rate they transact
      business for us, which I may add is a considerable shade lower than the
      general public pay. In future if you have any dealings on the market, I
      shall be glad to give you the benefit of both advice and introduction,
      which may result in your saving money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an investor, rather than a speculator,&rdquo; replied John, &ldquo;and more
      anxious to get good securities than exorbitant dividends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very wise rule of conduct,&rdquo; said the Colonel, nodding his head sagely
      several times; then, abruptly changing the subject, he once more expressed
      his pleasure at making the acquaintance of John Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live part of the year in New York, and part in this city,&rdquo; continued
      the Colonel, &ldquo;for I am a native here. I arrived a week ago, and to-morrow
      night we give a little house-warming which I should be glad, Mr. Steele,
      if you would attend. Not a great crush, you know; a homely gathering
      rather than a fashionable function, but you shall meet very choice people
      there, eh, Blair? You&rsquo;ll corroborate me in that, I&rsquo;m sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Colonel,&rdquo; responded Blair, &ldquo;you are altogether too modest. Your
      dinners might well form a model to Lucullus, and I can assure Mr. Steele
      that he will meet people whom it may be a great advantage for him to know.
      Now, there&rsquo;s a handsome, unsolicited testimonial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by Jove, it was solicited, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; cried the genial Colonel,
      rubbing his hands together. &ldquo;Well, Mr. Steele, may I depend on you? You
      will forgive the shortness of the notice, because of the shortness of our
      acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele accepted the invitation with a cordiality equal to that with
      which it was tendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prediction of both the stout gentlemen that John Steele would meet
      interesting people whom he should be glad to know was more than fulfilled,
      although his joy of new acquaintance was concentrated on one person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sadie Beck was the most beautiful girl Steele had ever seen. Her face
      was sweet and innocent; her complexion of purest ivory tinted with dawn,
      the colours that go with hair of Californian gold, profuse and waving; the
      whole entrancing picture being lighted up by eyes as blue as a June sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portals of the Beck mansion proved to be the gates of Eden, with Eve
      awaiting him within the Paradise. John, hitherto all unused to the society
      of women, found himself in the presence of Sadie Beck thrilled with
      emotions of which he knew nothing, and life quite unexpectedly presented
      possibilities that dazzled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Beck was a widower, and the only child of his only brother was
      mistress of his household. The Colonel had been too busy a man to think of
      marrying again after his wife had died, but circumstances solved the
      problem which his own immersion in great affairs prevented him from
      grappling with. His elder brother had been as unsuccessful in business as
      Colonel Beck was the reverse, and dying, he left his daughter to the care
      of her wealthy uncle, who had given her the most fashionable education
      money could procure, and then had installed her as the fascinating hostess
      of his home, a position which she amiably filled to the delight of his
      guests, and to the complacent satisfaction of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this new-born friendship upon John Steele was instantaneous
      and permanent. All the counsels which Philip Manson had formerly tendered
      to him, urging a greater care in his personal appearance, and a stricter
      attention to the niceties of dress had made but ephemeral impression upon
      the object of Manson&rsquo;s solicitations; but now, without a word being
      spoken, John became almost a modern dandy. The hairdresser&rsquo;s constant
      attention worked wonders with his head covering, and the most expensive
      tailors found him an exacting customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      John discovered suddenly that the onerous duties of division
      superintendent required a far wider outlook than he had so far bestowed
      upon them. He must know the law pertaining to his profession, and
      therefore he found frequent consultations necessary with the adviser to
      the corporation, and that urbane gentleman did his best to enlighten so
      diligent a student. Frequently, as was bound to happen with a man on whose
      shoulders rested a portion at least of the legal business pertaining to a
      wide-spreading railway system, Colonel Beck was occupied in his own study,
      compelled to refuse himself to any visitor, and great as should have been
      the disappointment of so earnest a pupil, John, nevertheless, could
      scarcely conceal his delight that the niece rather than the uncle should
      be his entertainer upon these occasions. The elderly lady who acted as
      chaperone in the Beck household was a placid nonentity, whom even a less
      strenuous person than John Steele might easily have ignored. She always
      contented herself with reading the latest book or magazine in a corner
      under the shaded electric light, while Sadie sat at the piano at the
      further end of the large room, and played most divinely certain soft,
      clinging, sentimental harmonies which might be carried on in conjunction
      with whispered conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie was a deservedly popular young lady, and often, to his chagrin, John
      found others in the drawing-room, claiming a share of her attention, and
      to do Miss Beck justice, she bestowed her favours with impartial charm
      upon all alike, although as time went on John Steele flattered himself
      that there was reserved for him a tone slightly more confidential than any
      of the others received. If the old Colonel saw what was going forward,
      almost, as one might say, before his eyes, he made no sign, and certainly
      treated the young division superintendent with an even cordiality that
      would have proved flattering to a man of much higher standing in the
      company&rsquo;s service than was John Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this interesting period of his existence the young man lived in an
      intoxicating, rose-hued atmosphere. &ldquo;Lucky in love, unlucky in war&rdquo; was
      proving itself false in his instance. Never before had he been so
      successful in his business; never so popular with superiors and
      subordinates alike. Difficulties appeared only to vanish before the magic
      wave of his hand. His suggestions were adopted, his plans prospered, and
      perhaps most inspiring of all, his sagacity and his energy met unasked
      appreciation. His salary was raised to a hundred dollars a week, and
      Blair, when he announced the fact, referred almost apologetically to the
      ever-increasing prosperity of the road, due largely, he was good enough to
      say, to the efficiency of the division superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet there was one pebble in his shoe. With increase of means,
      curiously enough, there came the increased knowledge that intrinsically he
      was a poor man. The property which a few months before had seemed wealth,
      now appeared what Blair had actually suggested it to be, merely the
      nucleus around which an energetic man might accumulate a fortune. He was
      in the social class of the millionaires, but not in their financial class.
      No matter what dividends were paid on two or three hundred thousand
      dollars&rsquo; worth of railway stock, that income, added to his salary of five
      thousand a year, would never support a palace such as Blair lived in, or
      even a mansion similar to the one inhabited by Colonel Beck. Sadie, with
      the demeanour of a queen, needed also the income of a queen. John had no
      delusions on that score, and furthermore, being proud, he could not ask
      her to step down, but to step up. The germ that had remained dormant in
      his mind since his uncle&rsquo;s death now developed into the belief that he
      might become as prosperous in speculation as he proved to be in all other
      walks in life. Often in after years he remembered the coincident
      conjunction of necessity, development and opportunity. Any two of the
      trinity would have been inactive without the presence of the third, but
      the trio travelling by different highways met at the crossroad, and then
      important things happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      One eventful evening he dressed for dinner and dined early at the club;
      then he strolled up the avenue to the residence of Colonel Beck. Ushered
      into the drawingroom he found Sadie standing by the open piano, idly
      touching the upper keys with the tips of her fingers, standing there as if
      she were waiting for him, yet he knew she was waiting for some one else,
      for her opera cloak hung over the back of a chair beside her, and she was
      arrayed superbly for dinner, ball or reception. Never afterward could John
      give to himself any lucid description of what she wore, except that she
      looked like a radiant angel garbed in white. Her raiment was diaphanously,
      airily beautiful. Her gleaming, snowy shoulders, superb neck, and crown of
      golden hair made up a vision almost unearthly in its loveliness, which at
      once entranced and startled the young man. She turned toward him that
      superbly poised head, with the arched brows of surprise at his entrance
      mellowed by a seductive smile of a welcome not to be misunderstood. John
      himself was one of those well-set-up young men who look their best in
      evening dress, and as he came rapidly forward down the long room the girl
      could see the soul shining in his eyes, and the sight brought added colour
      to her own fair cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sadie,&rdquo; he cried, taking both her hands in his, although she offered him
      only one, &ldquo;if but a painter could place on canvas even a hundredth part of
      your adorable beauty to-night, his fame would ring down the ages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so striking as all that? Then I am sorry I can give you but fifteen
      minutes of it, for my uncle is taking me out to dinner, and man-like he is
      late, having just arrived home and gone upstairs to dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen minutes! What is it the poet says of fifteen minutes as compared
      with a cycle of Cathay? Fifteen minutes, Sadie, with you, is worth an
      eternity with any one else on earth. Why, bless my soul, the Declaration
      of Independence was signed in ten!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the girl laughed, trying, not very strenuously, to disengage her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish me to sign a declaration of independence?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a declaration of independence from all the world except me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, a declaration of dependence on you rather than
      independence of the rest?&rdquo; she corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sadie, I&rsquo;ve adored you ever since I met you. The picture on canvas that I
      spoke of is impossible, for there is not genius enough existent to do it
      justice. But there is a picture I ask you to look at,&rdquo; and he swung her
      round almost rudely until she saw the reflection of two young people
      holding each other&rsquo;s hands in the tall pier-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you appreciate that Princess as she deserves, you will wonder at the
      conceit of the man standing beside her, that he dares to ask for the
      original.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sadie looked at her counterpart with a certain complacency, for doubtless
      she was a girl who had received many proposals, and was not to be swept
      from her feet even by one so impetuous as this. But that she was gratified
      by the young man&rsquo;s earnestness, one needed but a glance at her sparkling
      eyes and rosy cheeks to see. She turned from the glass to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the girl from New York or the gown from Paris you so warmly
      admire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me, Sadie, answer me,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I hear my uncle coming,&rdquo; and now she
      struggled in earnest to release herself, but strenuously he held her firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer yes or no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which word will release me most speedily?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it must be yes. A fine masterful lover you are!&rdquo; she cried with
      pretended indignation, as she whisked herself free from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a maid who came in, and taking up the white cloak, she adjusted it
      over the fair shoulders of her young mistress. A moment later the Colonel,
      rubicund and beaming, entered the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Steele, is that you?&rdquo; he saluted his visitor, shaking hands in the
      most friendly manner; &ldquo;has my niece told you that we must enact the
      inhospitable savage tonight, and turn you forth in a cold and pitiless
      world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Colonel,&rdquo; laughed John, who was in such a state of joyous exaltation
      that he would have laughed, no matter what his host had said, &ldquo;yes, and I
      must confess that it is like being turned from Paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, smiling, allowed his eyes to pass from the exuberant young
      man to the downcast face of his niece, who seemed absorbed in the
      rearrangement of her white cloak. If the Colonel suspected anything, he
      said nothing that might give a hint of his surmise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that Mr. Rockervelt is in town?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the young man, in some astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He arrived here by the noon train,&rdquo; continued the Colonel, &ldquo;and all this
      afternoon we have been in close session at Blair&rsquo;s house. Mr. Rockervelt
      spoke of you, and said he was sorry he could not see you this trip. We are
      dining with him to-night at Blair&rsquo;s, but ladies being present, no business
      will be talked. Mr. Rockervelt leaves by special at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a short stay,&rdquo; commented Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Short, but important,&rdquo; replied the Colonel, as he led the way to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Steele had the advantage of escorting Miss Sadie to her carriage, and
      the felicity of pressing her hand before he made way for the Colonel to
      enter. He stood there for a moment, watching the receding back of the
      carriage, and then walked uncertainly down the avenue, treading not upon
      hard flagstones, but on clouds, his mind far aloft in the realms of
      romance, while his body bumped heedlessly against innocent passers-by, or
      those who hoped to be passers-by <i>until</i> he ran into them,
      interrupting their course and causing one stranger to remark that it was a
      pity to see a young man so drunk this early in the evening.

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE FIRST CAST OF THE DICE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>EXT morning John
      Steele was startled to receive a rather peremptory message from Colonel
      Beck requesting him to call at once at his residence. The young man
      instantly obeyed, and mounted the steps with some trepidation, wondering
      whether Sadie had made a confidant of her uncle, and fearing that the
      uncle&rsquo;s designs for his niece excluded a division superintendent from any
      discussion regarding her future. He was shown into the Colonel&rsquo;s study, a
      large room on the first floor at the back of the house. The Colonel
      greeted him with what might be termed absent-minded friendliness. He was
      evidently perturbed about something, and after requesting his caller to
      sit down, himself paced up and down the room two or three times with a
      shade of perplexity on his brow. At last he threw himself into his office
      chair, and sitting back, interlocked his hands behind his head, and bent
      his looks upon the visitor he had summoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it best, Mr. Steele, to ask you to come here, as what I have to
      say is extremely private, and I wish to incur no interruptions, and to
      obviate the possibility of eavesdroppers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; interpolated John, thinking this opening must certainly pertain to
      the episode of the previous evening in the room beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said to me once,&rdquo; went on the Colonel, &ldquo;that you were an investor,
      not a speculator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; repeated his listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it ever occurred to you that a man may be both, or rather, that he
      may indulge in all the advantages of successful speculation without any of
      the risks that occur through playing in the open market?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If such a thing could be done,&rdquo; said John with a smile, &ldquo;it would be the
      very heaven of financiering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a thing not only can be done, but it <i>is</i> done, every day. It
      is the outsider who speculates, and who must incur the uncertainties which
      accompany speculation. Those on the inside do not speculate, but operate
      in a security as absolute as that of a bank which receives a certain
      amount from a depositor. Now, I told you last night that although Mr.
      Rockervelt&rsquo;s visit was brief, it was important. Its importance lies in
      this. The financial year now drawing to a close&mdash;the financial year,
      I mean, so far as the Rockervelt system is concerned&mdash;has been far
      and away the most prosperous in its existence. Manateau Midland stock
      to-day stands at 162 1/2, which is much under its intrinsic worth. But
      before I proceed with this exposition of values, I should like to ask you
      a question or two. Am I right in surmising that you owe your position
      entirely to Mr. Rockervelt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to him through Philip Manson&rsquo;s recommendation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Philip Manson! I believe he is one of Mr. Rockervelt&rsquo;s favourites,
      too. He was your predecessor, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Mr. Rockervelt took him to New York, and put me in his place here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chances are, then, that Mr. Manson will get his tip straight from Mr.
      Rockervelt himself, and, if he takes advantage of his knowledge, will
      doubtless operate through our brokers in New York. Well, the position is
      just this, Mr. Steele: Times have been good, and I tell you in confidence,
      what perhaps you have already guessed, that never has the Rockervelt
      system enjoyed a more prosperous year. The various roads, thanks to
      efficient men like yourself, have been remarkably free from disaster, and
      in truth during the twelve months now closing there has been no serious
      accident at all. In spite of our determination to let the actual state of
      affairs be known only to those on the inside, among whom Mr. Rockervelt,
      without saying it in so many words, evidently reckons yourself, the
      general public has arrived at some inkling of the facts. Stock which a
      month ago could be got for a hundred and fifty-two sells to-day at over a
      hundred and sixty. Still, the public has no real idea of how prosperous we
      have been, and I venture to predict that our next declaration of
      dividends, which is less than a month away now, will come as a complete
      surprise, and those who previously possessed inside knowledge will benefit
      accordingly. Of course, your duties heretofore have not brought you into
      contact with the finance of a huge corporation like the Rockervelt system,
      so I may tell you that after the annual meeting is held and a good
      dividend is declared the real owners of the railway, such as Mr.
      Rockervelt and his colleagues, sell their stock to the general public,
      buying it back during the ensuing year at a lower figure, in time for the
      next election of officers. We are now all loaded up with as much as we can
      carry, and it has been agreed that the time is ripe for the introduction
      of a very select few, like Manson, yourself and one or two more, into the
      inner circle. We take into our confidence only those who are actively
      engaged in the management and working of the various roads; men on whom we
      depend for our continued success. Now, our brokers have just been in
      communication with a man who wishes to sell stock to the amount of
      something like half a million, and I have asked them not to part with it
      or to seek a customer until I had communicated with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; said the young man, his face aglow with excitement at the
      chance offered to him, &ldquo;that is very kind of you, but you see, my money,
      or at least most of it, is already in Midland stock to the amount of
      between two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was aware of that, but our brokers will arrange everything for
      you. If, instead of buying the stock outright&mdash;and by the way, what
      did you pay for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got it at a trifle less than a hundred and fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there you are. Suppose you had, instead of buying it outright, taken
      an option, say, on a million, you would already have made a hundred
      thousand dollars on the rise. Our brokers will arrange the financial
      details and you can secure the stock you now possess and the half million
      block as well, with ample margin to spare. Then, when you have taken your
      profits, you can do as you please: reinvest if you like, or wait until the
      inevitable reaction comes and buy in at a lower figure a much larger
      amount than you now possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Colonel, I&rsquo;ll do it. In fact, I leave the matter entirely in
      your hands to arrange with the brokers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. I don&rsquo;t attempt to conceal from you that it is a great
      opportunity, and I need not ask you to hold in strict confidence all I
      have told you, for we don&rsquo;t care to see the price go much higher until
      after the dividend is declared. There&rsquo;s just one request I must make which
      perhaps you will have no hesitation in granting. We should like to secure
      the voting proxy of this stock against the general meeting, to be used in
      the Rockervelt interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; cried John, delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel selected some blank forms from the receptacle on his table
      before him, rapidly filled them in, and passed them across for John to
      sign, which he did almost without glancing at them, Colonel Beck in
      somewhat legal language pointing out the purport of each instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the Colonel, as he gathered up the signed
      papers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see the brokers at once, and get the deal put through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As John Steele came downstairs, he realised that these were business
      hours, but considered himself justified for the first time in his life in
      filching a few moments from them. He determined to see Sadie, and learn
      whether or not it was her wish he should at once communicate with her
      uncle on a matter which did not concern the buying or selling of stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie received him in a morning room that was partly library. Her first
      utterance rang with a tone of imperiousness that was new to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you been shut up with my uncle so long in his study this
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he sent for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he send for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make some arrangements about the future.&rdquo; Sadie&rsquo;s blue eyes were
      scintillating with excitement or anger; the young man could not quite tell
      which. &ldquo;What arrangements?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, our conference was strictly confidential, and your uncle asked me
      not to mention the subject to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl almost stamped her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well what I mean,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Did he send for you because
      of&mdash;because of&mdash;last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sadie, he didn&rsquo;t. To tell the truth, when I received his message this
      morning I thought perhaps he suspected something last night, and wished to
      question me, and I assure you I felt very uneasy meeting him before
      speaking first with you and learning your views upon the matter. However,
      his conversation was entirely about the railway business, and some new
      features of it, which arose through Mr. Rockervelt&rsquo;s visit yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you said nothing to him about last evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sadie, I could not take such a liberty without your permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; sighed the girl, with evident relief, &ldquo;you did give me a fright when
      I learned you had gone to my uncle&rsquo;s room so early in the morning, and
      when you stayed so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want me to speak of our engagement, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no engagement. You were so boisterous standing there by the
      piano that I had to say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; to release myself, otherwise my uncle would
      have come in upon a fine tableau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are not going back upon that &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the young man
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments the girl did not answer. She seemed in an uncertain
      temper that morning, and rather inclined to pout, yet to the ardent young
      man she appeared more entrancing than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going neither back nor forward,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;I desire to
      remain just where I am. I am not sure of myself. I think you took an
      unfair advantage of my dilemma last evening with your obstreperousness;
      and there are many reasons why I should not wish to be bound by the answer
      you forced me to give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not be bound,&rdquo; replied John very seriously; &ldquo;everything must be
      exactly as you wish it to be. You, doubtless, have been and will be sought
      by lovers richer than I, but you will never find one more devoted to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of riches,&rdquo; explained the girl petulantly; then
      after a pause she added: &ldquo;though I may as well confess I am quite unsuited
      to be a poor man&rsquo;s wife. The cottage with roses clambering over it looks
      very beautiful in a painting, and a description of it reads well in a
      magazine story, but when I was a small girl, I endured the reality of
      poverty and I don&rsquo;t want any more of it. I suppose you think that very
      sordid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined John Steele gravely, &ldquo;I think it very sensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should loathe a house in the suburbs with two servants, or its
      alternative, the middle-class hotel or superior boarding-house down town.
      My education and my bringing-up haven&rsquo;t fitted me for these delights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You incur no danger from a cheap house in the suburbs or its alternative.
      I am at present earning five thousand dollars a year, and am only on the
      threshold of my profession. I own absolute cash-producing property to the
      extent of about three hundred thousand dollars, and if you will consent to
      our engagement being made public when I am a millionaire, I guarantee that
      the announcement will take place before two months are past.&rdquo; Up to this
      point the girl&rsquo;s eyes had been fixed on the floor; now she raised them
      level with his, and he saw that all resentment had fled from them, leaving
      in its stead a sparkle of mischief and merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;one would think that the financial conversation
      upstairs with the uncle was resumed in the morning room with the niece. I
      suppose these monetary revelations arise because of the business suit you
      are wearing in this hard morning light; but I think I like you much
      better, John, in evening clothes, under the radiance of shaded lamps. I am
      sure neither of us thought of money last night, and I certainly did not
      this morning until you began talking about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held her hand out to him, and he took it with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish anything said of our engagement at the present moment,&rdquo; she
      went on. &ldquo;There is nothing very terrible about such a proviso, is there? I
      have many friends in this city, and I don&rsquo;t wish them all set gossipping,
      as will be the case if any announcement is made. We will let the &lsquo;<i>yes</i>&rsquo;
      stand where it did, but you must give me a little time quietly to learn
      how my uncle may regard the news. You will come here, I hope, just as if
      nothing had happened, and if I receive you as crossly as I did just now, I
      give you leave to scold me. Is that a bargain?&rdquo; she concluded brightly,
      smiling up at him, and giving him freely what he had taken the night
      before, her two hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a bargain,&rdquo; said John with content, drawing her suddenly toward him
      and kissing her, an act to which she submitted half with reluctance, half
      with acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so for a month everything went on as before, except that John was
      perhaps the most frequent visitor at the Beck household. He thought more
      of his love than of his money, as it is right and proper a young man
      should, for youth is the time of optimism, and everything was progressing
      smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week before the general meeting Blair departed for New York, and before
      he left he appointed Steele acting general manager <i>pro tem</i>., which
      had the effect of making John the busiest man in the city, giving him
      little opportunity to think of either femininity or finance. Colonel Beck
      accompanied Blair to the metropolis, but had returned the day before the
      annual meeting was held. There were large interests in the West, he said,
      which would require his unremitting attention during the next few days,
      and this proved a true prediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the day of the general meeting Steele left his office
      late, intending to snatch a hasty meal at the club and return to his work.
      He found the streets in unusual commotion; newsboys were rushing
      frantically here and there yelling at the top of their voices: &ldquo;Great
      panic in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele bought a paper, and the glance he bestowed upon the black headlines
      rooted him to the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Financial Thunderbolt,&rdquo; he read. &ldquo;No dividend for Rockervelt
      shareholders. Panic on the Stock Exchange this afternoon. Heavy drop in
      all securities. Rockervelt stocks leading the rout. Are we on the verge of
      a crisis? Fall of twenty-eight points in Rockervelt holdings when the
      Stock Exchange closed. Fears for tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-eight points,&rdquo; muttered the grave young man to himself. &ldquo;That
      means a loss to me of nearly two hundred thousand dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without reading further particulars, Steele thrust the paper into his
      pocket, and continued his journey to the club. His mind was in a whirl,
      but clenching his teeth, he strove to rearrange his thoughts and settle
      upon a course of action. It was too late that day to do anything. If he
      had only known of this disaster as soon as it occurred; if he had had word
      as early as was possible after the passing of the dividend, he might have
      got out without a loss of more than thirty or forty thousand dollars
      perhaps. What an innocent lamb he had been; almost begging to be shorn.
      Not a single precaution had he taken. It needed but a word to Philip
      Manson in New York, and a telegram would have apprised him at once of what
      had happened in the general meeting; yet here he had remained buried up to
      the eyes in the business of this corporation, which had evidently been
      engaged in a gigantic game of thimble-rigging; working like a fool while
      all the world knew of the topical item except himself. The reason of this
      complete absorption in duty suddenly struck him like a blow in the face,
      and he stood still at the thought of it. Blair had put upon his shoulders
      the burden of general manager without relieving him of the task of
      division superintendent, and he had been struggling to fulfil adequately
      the obligations of both offices. Had Blair done this for a purpose? One
      suspicion led to another. Might not the whole net in which he found
      himself enmeshed be of the general manager&rsquo;s weaving? If so, Blair had
      found him an easy victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      His meal at the club, instead of being snatched as he had intended, was a
      most leisurely one, but his appetite was gone and he ate little. He did
      not go back to his office, but walked up the avenue to Colonel Beck&rsquo;s
      house, only to find that the Colonel and his niece had gone out for the
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Steele was at his broker&rsquo;s office the moment it was opened. A crowd
      was collected before the place, but only those were allowed in who had
      dealings with the firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just about to telegraph you,&rdquo; said the junior partner, who received
      Steele in his private office. &ldquo;I rather expected you in yesterday, but as
      we had no instructions we held on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you telegraph me yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the broker, justly indignant at such a childish suggestion.
      &ldquo;You left no instructions, and as every ticker in town announced the news,
      I did not think it necessary. The fact is that as soon as the announcement
      came we were so busy here that no one in the office had time to turn
      round. The crash was so unsuspected we were not prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said John bitterly, &ldquo;that a firm like yours, intimately
      connected with the Rockervelt interests, should have had some idea of what
      was coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, so far as that goes,&rdquo; said the junior partner airily, &ldquo;I might
      be equally justified in saying that an official like yourself, holding an
      important position on the Rockervelt staff, would have been much more
      likely to get the straight tip than we.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I got a tip all right enough,&rdquo; replied John, grimly, &ldquo;but it seems to
      have been a crooked rather than a straight one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said the broker, with the easy nonchalance of one whose
      withers are unwrung, &ldquo;these mistakes happen now and then. The outlook in
      New York this morning is very-gloomy. Of course things may rally before
      noon, but we can&rsquo;t count on that. I was going to telegraph you that we
      must have margin put up; not less than twenty-one thousand dollars, and
      even that will only give you three points lee-way when your present margin
      is absorbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think twenty-one thousand would save me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo; answered the junior partner with a shrug of his shoulders.
      &ldquo;It all depends. If you can inform me what Mr. Rockervelt will do during
      the next two hours, I can predict what will happen with the stock. I
      expected he would support it, but apparently he is letting it go smash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he? He is the cause of it all,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I know the road
      earned a dividend, even if Rockervelt didn&rsquo;t declare one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there you are,&rdquo; said the broker. &ldquo;The public always loses its head
      at a time like this. Rockervelt stocks are now away below their intrinsic
      value, but that fact won&rsquo;t prevent their going lower if the panic
      continues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you advise me to do?&rdquo; asked Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give advice; I take instructions. We&rsquo;ll hang on just as long as
      we can, but if the decline continues, we must sell your block before it
      gets below the margin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hold three times twenty-one thousand, face value in Northern Pacific
      Stock. Can you tell me if there is any chance of raising twenty-one
      thousand dollars on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broker shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have done that two days ago, but now? with gilt-edged stock
      like Rockervelt&rsquo;s on the toboggan how can you expect to raise a loan on
      Northern Pacifics? I don&rsquo;t believe any one would venture a thousand
      dollars on that security to-day. Those who have money are sitting on it,
      waiting for the clouds to roll by. This may be merely a little financial
      flutter and a quick recovery, or it may prove the beginning of a
      commercial crisis that will last for two or three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet these devils in New York heedlessly run the whole country into such a
      risk to make a few more dirty dollars for themselves, who are already
      millionaires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The veins in Steele&rsquo;s forehead were swelling, and his hair bristled with
      indignation, but the broker merely threw back his head and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satan reproving sin!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What were you doing, a man with a
      quarter of a million or so, but trying to add a few dollars, dirty or
      clean, to that amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; said John, calming down suddenly, &ldquo;you are in the right.
      Well, good morning; I see there&rsquo;s a host waiting for you, and as you have
      no advice to give, and no money to lend, I&rsquo;ll see what I can do outside.&rdquo;
       He walked to the nearest telegraph station, and sent a message to Philip
      Manson in New York:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Can you telegraph me twenty-one thousand dollars? Will forward as
      security sixty thousand par-value Northern Pacific</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This handed over, he returned to his office, opened the safe, took out the
      Northern Pacific securities, and placed them on his desk. For an hour and
      a half he was busy giving directions to this man or that, then a telegram
      was brought in to him from Philip Manson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sorry, but have lost everything I possessed in yesterday&rsquo;s panic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Manson,&rdquo; mused Steele sadly. &ldquo;So he was caught in the trap too.
      Well, after all, when an old and experienced man is nipped, there is some
      excuse for myself.&rdquo; He thrust the securities in his pocket, put on his
      hat, and paid a visit to Colonel Beck. That benign gentleman received him
      with beaming effusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Steele, I am so sorry we were out when you called last evening.
      It was a little dinner to which I had accepted an invitation more than a
      week ago, little dreaming that such a financial storm was about to break
      over our heads. Sit down, Steele, sit down. What can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can lend me twenty-one thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile faded from the cherubic face of the Colonel, and a shade of
      melancholy took its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, then, that your margins have all but disappeared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would twenty-one thousand save you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell that better than I, Colonel, being more in the confidence of
      the Rockervelts. I offer you as security nearly three times the amount in
      Northern Pacific stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel slowly shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t ask for security at all, Mr. Steele, if I had the ready
      money, but this unexpected crisis has tied up all the funds at my
      disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unexpected! Do you mean to tell me you did not know the dividend was to
      be passed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Beck placed the tips of his fingers together, and gazed across the
      apex before him at the young man, more in sorrow than in anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Steele, I have no doubt you heard the news before I did. As I
      told you in this very room, large dividends had been earned, and of course
      I came to the conclusion that they would be declared. Then you say, quite
      justly, if a dividend was earned, why was it not declared? The reason is a
      most convincing one, and I am expecting every moment Mr. Rockervelt to
      give it to the public. When he does so, people will learn how senseless is
      the panic which has ensued over what is, after all, an exceedingly simple
      matter; one of those exigencies of business which are constantly
      occurring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While I was in New York I was consulted about the case; indeed the main
      lines of the deal were settled, although the method of payment was left
      open. You may be aware that Mr. Rockervelt is aiming at the Pacific coast,
      and gradually extending his lines to the west. Very well. About a week ago
      he got a private offer of the L. S. &amp; D. Road, for which at the
      present moment he has no use, but which in a few years&rsquo; time, when he
      makes certain connections, will be a most valuable link in his chain to
      California. Now, Mr. Rockervelt seeks advice, and listens to it, but no
      man can tell whether he will follow that advice or not. The information I
      have received from New York is to the effect that at the last moment Mr.
      Rockervelt made up his mind that instead of declaring a large dividend, as
      he might have done, he would put the amount in the L. S. &amp; D. Road. Of
      course, he could have explained this at the meeting, but he did not do so,
      and there I think he was wrong. However, as you know, he works along his
      own lines, and perhaps his announcement might have raised difficulties
      before all the papers were signed. I imagine this is why he has made no
      statement. The truth is that just after the meeting he left in his private
      car for the West, intending to go over the L. S. &amp; D. Road, but I am
      sure that when he realises the effect of his reticence on the business
      affairs of the country, he will be prompt to make his explanation, and
      save any further depreciation of securities. His manifesto will doubtless
      appear in to-night&rsquo;s papers, or in the morning sheets at the latest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that won&rsquo;t help me, Colonel Beck, and as you are yourself
      unable to accommodate me with the money for a few days, I suppose it would
      be useless to ask if any of your wealthy friends would accept my
      securities and hand me over the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear not, I fear not,&rdquo; said the Colonel, with an air of inexpressible
      sadness. &ldquo;At times like these every one pulls tight the purse-strings. If
      I went to the richest friend I have and asked to be accommodated with a
      loan, telling him the true story of the passing of this dividend, I am
      very sure I should not be believed.&rdquo; John rose to his feet, a wry smile on
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather deplorable, Colonel Beck,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;that people
      should so distrust their fellow men, and even though you say so, I find it
      impossible to believe that any one should suspect you of setting a trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; sighed the Colonel, &ldquo;we must take life as we find it, you
      know, and not as we would have it. Time sets all things right, and I am
      old enough to be philosophical. Must you go? Well, drop in when you can,
      and if the financial tension relaxes, I may be able to be of some
      assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John went downstairs and, as on a former occasion, expressing a wish to
      see the young lady of the house, was conducted into the morning room,
      where she greeted him, as it seemed to his now over-sensitive nerves,
      somewhat distantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sadie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I told you in this room that I was worth three hundred
      thousand dollars; that I was earning a salary of five thousand dollars a
      year, and that within two months I expected to be a millionaire. I must
      now inform you that all my money has been swept away, that I am about to
      resign my five thousand a year, and that I shall probably never be more of
      a millionaire than I am at the present moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; said the girl, with the breathless haste of one who is
      confronted by a condition, and does not know the exact words that fit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry too,&rdquo; said John simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there for a full minute, and there was silence between them,
      until at last the girl appeared to force herself to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, you are young, Mr. Steele, and this is a country of great
      opportunities, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is,&rdquo; said John, with a grin; &ldquo;yes, it is generally understood
      to be a land of excellent chances, and, as you say, I am young, much
      younger than when I was in this room last time. I knew as a general
      proposition I was young, but I had no idea I was the infant I have found
      myself to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the girl drew herself up, and tried to assume an air of
      haughty indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are laughing at me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think it is very unkind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my word, Miss Beck, that I do not feel much like laughing, and
      least of all at you. I merely came in to bid you good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand, and she took it gingerly, at arm&rsquo;s length, as it
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I wish you luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied John simply.
    </p>

      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;AN IMPENDING CHANGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O borrow money at
      any time is difficult; to borrow during a panic is impossible. John Steele
      spent the first half of the second day of the crisis in attempting the
      impossible. Every man to whom he applied seemed to be in the same position
      as himself. All stocks had come down in sympathy with the Rockervelt
      slump, and it seemed as if every person supposed to be rich was then
      engaged in a frantic endeavour to prevent ruin by putting up all the ready
      money in hand, or else trying, like John himself, to borrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half past twelve he gave up the quest, and made a second call on his
      brokers. It was the junior partner again who received him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Steele,&rdquo; cried the broker, &ldquo;here you are, eh? They say all things
      come to him who waits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t true in my case,&rdquo; replied John. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting all day for
      money and couldn&rsquo;t get it. It didn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you,&rdquo; rejoined the broker. &ldquo;I have had
      messengers after you all over town. Called at your rooms, at your office,
      at your club; found any number of people who had just seen you, but not
      one of the searchers caught sight of <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the news?&rdquo; asked John, without much hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hung on to your stock till ten minutes to twelve, and then we had to
      let it go. We were lucky enough to get a purchaser for the whole block at
      a price that just cleared us, but I can tell you I spent a bad quarter of
      an hour before I got into touch with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you say cleared, I suppose you mean that I&rsquo;m entirely wiped out, but
      you got from under without loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a better way of putting it than that,&rdquo; replied the broker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think there was a man in town with ready money enough to make
      such a purchase to-day. I wish I had managed to encounter him. Perhaps I
      might have detached twenty-one thousand dollars from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very likely, for he is a friend of yours, and from your own office.
      He said there was no secret about it; so I may as well tell you the
      purchaser is Mr. Blair, general manager of the Midland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s back from New York, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he returned this morning; haven&rsquo;t you seen him? Haven&rsquo;t you been at
      your office at all today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve been calling on friends and acquaintances. I suppose the stock
      is going up now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, such a large purchase had first the effect of putting the brakes on
      its downhill course, and now it has recovered two points. Then the news
      from New York is encouraging. It seems that the Rockervelt forces, both in
      New York and Chicago, are buying all that is offered. You see, Mr.
      Rockervelt himself left for the West just before the scare, and I imagine
      he didn&rsquo;t realise how serious it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. I heard he had gone West. Pity there are no telegraph wires to
      the West, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broker laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess Mr. Rockervelt is as foxy as they make &rsquo;em. I don&rsquo;t
      suppose he&rsquo;s lost anything over this shake-up, and perhaps he thought it
      was a good time to squeeze a little of the dampness out of the stock. I
      expect a very rapid recovery. The country is prosperous, and from the way
      things look this last hour or two we&rsquo;ve been going through a little
      squall, but not entering upon a financial crisis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a blessing,&rdquo; said John with a sigh; &ldquo;still, the squall has upset
      my canoe, even if the big liners ride through it. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once outside, instead of feeling depressed, as he had expected, John
      experienced an unaccountable thrill of elation. The disaster was complete;
      complete beyond recall; complete in spite of anything he did or did not
      do. The very finality of the catastrophe seemed to lift a weight that had
      been oppressing him for a night and a day. He remembered that he had had
      practically no dinner the evening before, and no breakfast that morning,
      and now a fierce and healthy hunger which seemed to have been biding its
      time sprang upon him. A glance at his watch showed that it was nearly two
      o&rsquo;clock. He walked rapidly to the University Club, noted for its excellent
      cuisine, and wrote on an order card the menu of a sumptuous meal. A
      deferential servitor approached silently to his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Steele, No. 1623 wants you on the telephone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, ring him up, and tell him I&rsquo;ll be there in a moment, and if he
      is impatient, inform him I am at present engaged on the important choice
      between camembert and brie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sending his order upstairs, he went into the little telephone cabin. He
      knew the number meant the general manager&rsquo;s office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, is that you, Blair?&mdash;Yes, this is Steele.&mdash;What&rsquo;s that?&mdash;Oh,
      no, now that you mention it, I haven&rsquo;t been there last night or this
      morning. How&rsquo;s the old road running?&mdash;What? It isn&rsquo;t doing so well
      outside.&mdash;Oh, if it comes to that, I&rsquo;ve been general manager and
      division superintendent for the past week, so surely you can act Pooh Bah
      for a day. To tell the truth, it seemed to me that a road whose stock was
      falling so rapidly wasn&rsquo;t worth general managering or division
      superintending.&mdash;Levity? Bless you, no! I&rsquo;m the most serious man in
      town.&mdash;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry you think my remarks flippant. Have you had
      lunch? I&rsquo;ve just ordered a meal for a millionaire; come down and have a
      bite with me.&mdash;Oh, had it, eh? You&rsquo;re an early bird. I&rsquo;ve ordered a
      late bird grilled upstairs. Sure you won&rsquo;t drop round, and have a cup of
      coffee and a liqueur?&mdash;Yes, I see, you&rsquo;re quite right. Somebody must
      attend to business.&mdash;Well, I&rsquo;ll drop round on you at four o&rsquo;clock.
      Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele allowed himself a good hour and three-quarters for his
      luncheon, then he strolled down to the Grand Union Station, and, exactly
      as the big bell in the tower tolled four he walked into the general
      manager&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blair was seated at his broad table, and as he looked up his chubby
      face was a study in various emotions. Superficially it wore the
      conventional, official frown which a great man may call to his aid when a
      subordinate&rsquo;s conduct has been such as to merit disapproval. The severity
      of the frown, however, was chastened by the expression of the just man,
      who, although righteously offended, is nevertheless prepared to listen to
      an explanation, and perhaps accept an apology. The lips were prepared to
      censure, or even, in a last resort, to condemn, although, if the case
      merited leniency, one would not be surprised to hear them admonish and
      advise. It was the face of a simple and honest man, willing to forgive,
      yet not afraid to punish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes, however, rather gave the situation away. In them twinkled
      triumph and glee, and lurking in their depths was a background of malice
      and hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Steele, I was amazed to find on my return from New York that you had
      absented yourself without permission from your duties,&rdquo; began Mr. Blair,
      in a sincere more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said John airily. &ldquo;I was general manager <i>pro
      tem</i>., you see, and a general manager may do what he pleases. But I was
      division superintendent also, so I asked the general manager for an hour
      or two off, and permission was granted me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you know, Mr. Steele, I am the most forbearing of men, but such a tone
      as you have adopted will not do. As I told you over the telephone I was
      surprised at the flippant manner you thought fit to adopt, but I expected
      a satisfactory explanation when we met face to face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is the case, sir, I shall be so sorry to disappoint you. The
      satisfactory explanation I beg to offer for my absence is that I was
      busily engaged in gambling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gambling!&rdquo; cried Mr. Blair in astonishment; &ldquo;this is shocking. It is my
      opinion that a man cannot be an efficient servant of a great railway and a
      speculator at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you, Mr. Blair, and we are two shining examples of the
      truth of your aphorism. You are the most inefficient railway servant I
      ever met, and at the same time the most successful gambler. I am an
      excellent railway man and the most idiotic speculator there is in the
      country at the present moment. What&rsquo;s the use of wasting that
      sanctimonious &lsquo;holier-than-thou&rsquo; look of yours? You know, and I know, that
      you don&rsquo;t care a hang about my being away a day. What you want me here
      for is to gloat over me. You&rsquo;ve got my three hundred thousand dollars as
      slick as any bunco man ever achieved a much smaller sum over a green farm
      hand from the country. I&rsquo;m here, not to receive any censure or to make any
      apology, but so that you may enjoy the effects of my humiliation and
      defeat. I am the last person in the world to deprive another of innocent
      amusement. Here I am, therefore. I have just come out of the tail end of
      the threshing machine, and have brought the remnants for your inspection.
      What do you think of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am exceedingly sorry to hear that you have been unfortunate in your
      financial transactions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you are. Thanks ever so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you succeed in raising twenty-one thousand on your Northern Pacific
      stock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have it with me yet. That N. P. stock sticks to me closer than any
      friend I have in town. You don&rsquo;t want to buy it by any chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Blair smoothly. &ldquo;I have quite recently made a very large
      investment in Midland shares, re-buying a block that I was fortunate
      enough to sell at its highest point, and have therefore no desire to
      acquire further securities at the present moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just in the same fix as all the rest of my acquaintances, Mr.
      Blair, so your refusal does not disappoint me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lost also the thirty thousand you had in the Bank at Detroit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was said very quietly, and for a moment amazed the listener by the
      accurate knowledge the elder man possessed of his affairs. The next
      instant John Steele gave utterance to a shriek of laughter, smiting his
      thigh with his open palm as if he had just heard the best joke in the
      world. The young man strode up and down the room giving way to shout after
      shout of hilarity, while the elder, all trace of humbug vanishing from his
      face, rose to his feet in alarm, believing that misfortune had turned the
      other&rsquo;s brain, and fearing a transformation into a sudden savagery that
      might make his isolated position one of danger. His eyes rested longingly
      on the door, while his hand nervously sought the electric button. John,
      seeing these premonitions of interruption, controlled himself with an
      effort, and stammered: &ldquo;Sit down, Blair; it&rsquo;s all right. Don&rsquo;t get
      frightened. I&rsquo;ll explain in a minute. You see, it was this way,&rdquo; said
      John, coming up in front of the table again, and resolutely crushing down
      his bubbling tendency to merriment; &ldquo;that thirty thousand was deposited in
      the Detroit bank by my late uncle. I possess my own little bank account
      here, which I have been adding to week by week. Consequently, I never
      needed to draw a check upon Detroit. Now, the funny thing is that I have
      been searching this town from cellar to garret that I might borrow
      twenty-one thousand dollars, and all the while I could have drawn my own
      check for the amount, and had nine thousand odd left over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say, then,&rdquo; said Blair, visibly disappointed, &ldquo;that you
      didn&rsquo;t put in the thirty thousand as margin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not. Do you feel you ought to have a check for that thirty
      thousand? You remind me of the hotel keeper at a summer resort down East,
      whose customer said: &lsquo;You have made a mistake in my bill,&rsquo; and when the
      proprietor denied that there could be any error, the guest explained: &lsquo;Oh,
      there must be, for I have still ten dollars left.&rsquo; The beautiful part of
      it is, Blair, that if I had thought of my thirty thousand I would have put
      it in; so I am mighty glad I didn&rsquo;t think of it, for it would not have
      saved me. I was looking over the figures of the decline on the tape at the
      club, and found that the stuff reached its lowest point at about half-past
      eleven, and that point would have not only wiped out my thirty thousand,
      but another thirty thousand as well. The brokers told me they had hung on
      till ten minutes to twelve, but they evidently knew their customer, and
      got out on the rise. I am afraid, Blair, that even brokers are not
      truthful men. It&rsquo;s a wonder that staunch, true hearts like you and me can
      make a living in this deceitful world. Well, Mr. Blair, I have come to bid
      you good-bye, and I venture to predict that I&rsquo;ll have more fun out of that
      thirty thousand dollars than I had out of the three hundred thousand.
      Wealth isn&rsquo;t everything here below. Meanwhile keep on living a virtuous
      life, and you will reap your reward by and by. Never become discouraged in
      well-doing. Ta-ta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that John Steele took his departure from the Grand Union Station,
      packed up his traps, and took train for Detroit, where he lifted his money
      from the bank, and left on the night express for New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he rented Drawer 907 in the Broadway Safe Deposit Vaults, and in this
      drawer he placed his Northern Pacific stock and locked it up. He next
      turned his money, all but a thousand dollars, into a letter of credit on
      Europe; then bought a first-class ticket to France on the biggest boat
      sailing that week. He determined to burn his bridges behind him before he
      called on his old friend Philip Manson, for he knew instinctively that
      Manson would strongly disapprove of the course he had laid out for
      himself, and, remembering his great esteem and affection for Manson, he
      was not sure enough of himself to venture within the circle of his
      influence without some extraneous aid to hold him to his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearing twelve o&rsquo;clock when he went up in one of the half-dozen
      elevators of the huge Rockervelt building, and was ushered into Philip
      Manson&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Mr. Manson, how are you?&rdquo; he cried cheerily, as his former chief
      rose to greet him. Although he called the much more important general
      manager plain &ldquo;Blair,&rdquo; he never was able to drop the prefix &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; from
      Man-son&rsquo;s name. His respect for his solemn friend was as deep as his
      affection, and the strong regard manifested itself unconsciously in this
      manner. Manson&rsquo;s appearance gave no indication that he had passed through
      a crisis which had ruined him. He was the same quiet, reserved man he had
      always been, and a touch of grey at the temples was all the change John
      noticed as having taken place since he saw him last. The stern face
      relaxed into a bright expression of welcome as he shook hands with the
      young man from the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to see you,&rdquo; said Manson. &ldquo;Did you get my letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I left Warmington the day I telegraphed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It was merely about your telegram I wrote. I
      am very sorry indeed that it proved impossible for me to send you the
      money, and I merely wrote a fuller explanation than my telegram
      contained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got caught in the crash, then?&rdquo; said Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, everything I possessed was swept away. It serves me right for doing
      what I never did in my life before, which is to dabble in stocks. Was I
      right in supposing from your telegram that you also had become involved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and if you had sent me the money it would have been lost; so you
      see, you don&rsquo;t need to regret that you didn&rsquo;t have it. The funny thing is
      that I had myself thirty thousand dollars in the Detroit Bank, which, in
      the excitement of the day, slipped my memory as effectually as if it had
      been only thirty cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you save it?&rdquo; asked Manson, with as near an approach to eagerness
      as he could show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, but the saving was an act of Providence, as we always try to
      make out our accidents are, and not through any sanity on my part. How did
      you come to put everything in stocks? I thought you never gambled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, up till about a week ago. Colonel Beck gave me the straight
      tip, which I understood came direct from Mr. Rockervelt, and I was foolish
      enough to act upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did the same kind office for me, but he&rsquo;s merely a stool-pigeon for
      old Blair. Blair was the man behind the gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no proof of that,&rdquo; said Manson, judicially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> have proof. Blair didn&rsquo;t hesitate to confess as much after he
      had raked in my money. Blair&rsquo;s one of those oily hypocrites who smile and
      smile, and remain the villain. He never forgives, though he may appear to
      do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were always inclined to be prejudiced against Mr. Blair, John,&rdquo; said
      Manson meditatively. &ldquo;Still, there&rsquo;s little use in talking of what is
      past. I suppose you read Mr. Rockervelt&rsquo;s statement in the papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable piece of virtuous indignation, isn&rsquo;t it? What a beautiful
      sermon against all speculation! And yet it is stated very freely that
      those on the inside have made millions by selling the road and buying it
      back again. I wonder what fool it was that said you couldn&rsquo;t have your
      cake and eat it too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s think no more about it. When are you going back West, John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave to-morrow, at noon, but I don&rsquo;t go West; I go East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;East?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I sail on the first out-going liner to-morrow, and hope to drop off
      in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve never given up your situation, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it was impossible for me to remain. I&rsquo;m done with railroading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense. What&rsquo;s your purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Manson, I don&rsquo;t exactly know. Reason tells me that I&rsquo;m no worse off
      than I was the day my uncle died, when I had little thought of coming into
      any money I didn&rsquo;t earn. Indeed, I am very much better off. My salary has
      been doubled. I have thirty thousand dollars in cash, and a bundle of
      Northern Pacific securities which has just been placed in the Broadway
      Safe Deposit. I don&rsquo;t understand myself in the least. Reason tells me that
      I ought to get angry and slaughter somebody, yet I feel no resentment. I
      am hurt, rather, that I was sand-bagged in the house of my friends. Still,
      even that fact doesn&rsquo;t appear to affect me much. Nevertheless, there&rsquo;s a
      change. I suspect it&rsquo;s the beginning of dry-rot. I fear that from being a
      useful man I have become a useless one. The utter folly of hard work,
      faithful service, reasonable honesty, and all that, has been brought home
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense, John,&rdquo; expostulated Manson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not theorising, Mr. Manson, but am merely trying to explain
      something to you which I do not myself understand. My uncle managed to get
      together a certain amount of money during thirty-five years. I lost that
      money in as many hours. If I worked honestly like a beaver for the next
      ten, fifteen or twenty years, it is unlikely I could save that much; yet
      my dear friend Blair, during, say, half an hour&rsquo;s silent meditation,
      evolves a plan, perfectly legal, by which the money is transferred from my
      bank account to his&mdash;transferred beyond possibility of recall. You
      will say perhaps, as my broker said, that I am just as bad as he is. I
      expected to place some one else&rsquo;s money in my bank account, beyond recall,
      and didn&rsquo;t succeed. Therefore I make a row. But the truth is, I am not
      making a row. I admit all any critic may say of my folly, but I realise
      that being an honest, hard-working efficient man doesn&rsquo;t pay in this
      country. At least, it pays only in allowing you to scrape together a
      modest competency, which may be quite lawfully filched from you in ten
      minutes. You will add I am a fool to throw over my shoulder a situation
      worth five thousand a year. You may even mention the hundred thousand
      young fellows of my age who would jump at my chance. I admit all that; I
      admit I&rsquo;m a fool; I admit anything. I am the most open-minded person on
      earth at the present moment, and the least argumentative. I am like a boat
      that has been tied to a pier until somebody has cut the rope, sending it
      adrift. If you ask the boat where it&rsquo;s going, it doesn&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t
      know what I&rsquo;m going to do. I am only aware that I&rsquo;ve got close on thirty
      thousand dollars in a letter of credit. I can have a high old time on that
      money for a year in Paris. I can have an hilarious time on it for two
      years in various capitals. I can study in Germany with the greatest luxury
      for five or ten years on that amount, or I can live thirty years in Europe
      in some quiet out-of-the-way place and be sure I shan&rsquo;t die of starvation.
      I&rsquo;m all at sea, like the boat I was speaking of. I thought I knew John
      Steele pretty well, but I find I don&rsquo;t know him at all. All his ideas of
      morality, energy, industry, have turned somersaults. I am going over to
      Europe, where it&rsquo;s quiet, to get acquainted with the new John Steele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip Manson had been regarding him with almost painful concentration
      while he spoke, and when the harangue was finished he said, soothingly,
      persuasively, looking at John: &ldquo;Come with me up to the Adirondacks and
      enjoy a week&rsquo;s fishing, or to Maine, and put in two weeks, or to Canada,
      and stay three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I know. Why don&rsquo;t you advise me to go to some sanitarium and
      consult a physician on mental aberration? I want to fish, but it is to
      fish out the secrets of John Steele. By this time to-morrow I shall be
      kissing the tips of my fingers to the statue of Liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; said Manson, solemnly, &ldquo;you are taking a false step. If you go to
      Europe in this frame of mind you are making a grave mistake which may not
      be easily remedied. Opportunities come once, twice, thrice, but they don&rsquo;t
      come always, and if they find a man persistently not at home, they pass
      on. In a year or two this little set-back you have experienced will have
      almost completely passed away from your mind. Look at me. I am a much
      older man than you. I have lost everything I succeeded in accumulating,
      yet I set my face toward re-earning it. You are on the threshold of a
      great success; you have in you the making of a first-class general
      manager. Now, I can well understand that you don&rsquo;t care to be in an office
      that contains Mr. Blair. I cannot say I blame you for that, but Mr.
      Rockervelt will be back here the day after to-morrow. You wait till he
      comes; I&rsquo;ll go in and see him, and I am sure you will be offered a
      position that will give you ample scope for the powers we both know you to
      possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele shook his head slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you, and evidently you don&rsquo;t believe it, that I have no
      desire to develop any powers of usefulness I may possess. I suppose I am
      in the state of mind that makes a labouring man become a tramp. You are a
      stalwart oak of the forest, Mr. Manson, and the gale that has merely
      ruffled your branches has uprooted the sapling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, John; it has simply given the sapling a bit of a twist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be so. It is quite possible that by the time I touch at
      Southampton or Cherbourg I may be yearning for that stolid old statue of
      Liberty again, and perhaps I shall take the next steamer back. In that
      case Mr. Rockervelt will have had the disadvantage of endeavouring to run
      his system without me for three weeks or thereabouts, and so we will deal
      with him more effectually than we would the day after to-morrow, when he
      doesn&rsquo;t know what a vacuum my absence has caused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to be cynical, John. It doesn&rsquo;t sound convincing from the lips
      of so sensible and capable a young fellow as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; John went on unheeding, &ldquo;it may be that I have taken
      to the road; that I am in reality the tramp I feel myself to be. Perhaps
      there has been a mistake in the outset, and Europe is really my country,
      not America. My father was born over there, and who knows but that
      thousands of years of ancestry are calling to me. That is a question
      Europe will settle. I half suspect that I shall feel so out of it after a
      month over there that you&rsquo;ll find me again coming up this express elevator
      before you realise I&rsquo;ve been away. Any how, my steamer ticket is in my
      pocket, and I am off to Cherbourg or wherever they like to land me, in the
      morning. And now, Mr. Manson, you know this wicked city better than I do.
      Let&rsquo;s get out to some good eating house and enjoy a substantial meal.
      What&rsquo;s the best restaurant in town? It isn&rsquo;t every day a capitalist asks
      you to lunch with him. I&rsquo;m the prodigal son, so we&rsquo;ll reverse the ancient
      parable and kill the fatted calf before I start on my travels.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;LOVE&rsquo;S SPECTRE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>OHN STEELE sat at
      one of the little round tables in the Café Germania, where a customer may
      have brown Munich beer in a big stone mug with a white metal lid. The <i>café</i>
      was very full, so also were some of the <i>habitués</i>; and on a raised
      platform at the corner were seated the members of a Viennese band, giving
      forth music in the smoke-beclouded room. Steele was waiting for a friend,
      and had turned a chair face forward against the little table, that a place
      might be ready for him when he arrived. With his fountain-pen the young
      man had just written a cable despatch, in answer to a transatlantic
      message that lay before him, mutilated somewhat in its English, as is the
      habit of Italian telegraph offices, but still understandable, which was
      lucky, for more often than not a telegram in a foreign language comes out
      second best after an encounter with the system of Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A breezy individual made his way through the smoke and the throng to the
      vacant chair, tipped it back and sat down in it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m late, as usual,
      John,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but that is one of my official prerogatives. So I won&rsquo;t
      apologise, but will make it up in beer, now that I am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is little use of being United States Consul at Naples if you can&rsquo;t
      do as you like, Jimmy. There isn&rsquo;t any too much money in the office, so
      one must seek compensation in other directions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as I like? That&rsquo;s exactly what I can&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;ll be hanged if every
      citizen of the great Republic that blows in on me in Naples doesn&rsquo;t seem
      to imagine I&rsquo;m a sort of man-of-all-work for him. And I&rsquo;m expected to be
      polite, and to fetch and carry for all concerned. Truth to tell, Steele,
      I&rsquo;m tired of it; I&rsquo;ve a notion to chuck the whole outfit and go back. Now,
      to-night, I was kept at my office long after business hours by a
      persistent man who would not take &lsquo;No&rsquo; for an answer&mdash;actually
      thought I was lying to him, and had the cheek to intimate as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I was; but it was not etiquette for him to throw out any hints
      about my lack of veracity. It was all on your account, and I&rsquo;d indulge in
      any amount of fiction to oblige a friend. He wanted your address, and
      wanted it badly; but I didn&rsquo;t know that you were anxious to see him, so I
      prevaricated and told him that if he came in to-morrow morning I&rsquo;d see if
      I could get it for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s singular. No one has been looking for me for years past. I thought
      and hoped I had been forgotten over in the States. What was his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is his card. Colonel Beck, of New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Beck! Thunder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know him? Don&rsquo;t wish to see him, I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, Stokes, for holding him off.
      How long is he going to stay in Naples?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said he was going to stay till he found you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I&rsquo;ll strike for Calabria or Sicily or somewhere; get among
      the real brigands and avoid this pirate. He used to be a legal adviser to
      the Rockervelts and probably is yet. Supposed to be rich through fleecing
      innocent lambs like myself. The shorn lamb, however, avoids the wolf, so
      I&rsquo;m off to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of leaving now if your fleece is gone? He can&rsquo;t hurt you.
      Did he shear you in days gone past?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story. What strikes me, however, is the coincidence of old
      Beck turning up at this moment. There is, in fact, a coincidence within a
      coincidence. Read that cablegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele shoved over to his friend the message he had received that day from
      New York. The Consul wrinkled his brows over the Italian-English of the
      despatch, and made out its purport to be as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>John Steele, Naples.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Have you block Northern Pacific? If so, send me particulars and full
      powers to deal. Act at once. Stock booming, but expect a crash shortly.
      Come over yourself if you can, immediately. The block will make you rich
      if realised without delay.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Manson.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Manson?&rdquo; asked the Consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip Manson was my chief on the Manateau Midland Railway before he went
      east to New York. I succeeded him on the Midland. He and I lost about all
      we possessed in the Rockervelt panic a few years ago. I was what you would
      call a &lsquo;quitter&rsquo; and came to Europe. Manson was a &lsquo;holdfast&rsquo; and so he is
      still in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not go right over and see him, instead of taking that trip to
      Calabria?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to tell the truth, I do feel a yearning for the States, but I think
      I&rsquo;ll wait until I hear how this deal turns out. Read my answer to his
      cablegram,&rdquo; and the young man handed to his friend the document he had
      written before the other came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Stock in Broadway Safe Deposit vaults. Drawer nine hundred seven.
      Mailed you ten days ago key and legal papers. Make what you can, and we
      will share even.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Steele.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was wondering where I had seen the name Man-son before!&rdquo; cried the
      Consul. &ldquo;Were those papers you signed in my office a week or two since the
      documents referred to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very strange. You sent them across ten days before you got the
      request for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Those shares had rested for years in the Safe Deposit Vaults.
      Manson had never referred to them in his letters to me and I had never
      referred to them in my letters to him, yet I suddenly made up my mind to
      throw them on the market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that almost makes a person believe there is something in this
      thought-wave theory&mdash;telepathy, or whatever they call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it has a much more prosaic origin. A fortnight since you told
      me there had been a tremendous rise in Northern Pacific stock. That set me
      thinking, and I remembered I had a number of shares hidden away in Drawer
      907. The stock was of no use to me, so I thought I might as well discover
      how badly some other fellow wanted it. Thus I threw the onus of selling on
      my friend Manson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have a good deal of confidence in him to give him a free hand
      like that. What&rsquo;s to hinder him from bolting with the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all, except that he won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love to meet this charming belief in one&rsquo;s fellow man these cynical
      times, but I thought you said you lost money with him. Was he your
      partner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The losing of the money was through no fault of his. He had nothing
      to do with my speculation. We were merely in the same boat, that&rsquo;s all.
      Nipped by the same pair of pinchers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that was what disgusted you with America. I am disappointed with your
      story. Wasn&rsquo;t there a woman concerned at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does our friend Colonel Beck come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beck comes in owing to the fact that he persuaded me to undertake the
      speculation by which I lost several hundred thousand. He gave me false
      information, and I believe he knew it to be false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any proof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Circumstantial evidence, that&rsquo;s all. I believed him to be my friend,
      and in fact acted the tenderfoot to perfection. I was even green enough to
      go to him when the crisis came, believing that a loan of twenty thousand
      or thereabout would save me, but he refused to let me have the money,
      although I offered this same stock I am cabling about as security.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t have the money, like the man who neglected to buy
      Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said his ready money had been swept away by the panic, which I doubt.
      I have never seen him since, and somehow have no particular desire to meet
      him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I appreciate your feeling in the matter. By the way, Steele, there was a
      very pretty girl with Colonel Beck&mdash;a <i>very</i> pretty girl, and
      charmingly attired. She did not say a word all the time the Colonel was
      talking, but she looked unutterable things and was deeply interested in
      our conversation. I thought she was a trifle disappointed when I told the
      Colonel I didn&rsquo;t know where you were. I supposed she was the Colonel&rsquo;s
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chances are,&rdquo; mused Steele, &ldquo;that the young lady is Miss Sadie Beck,
      niece of the old gentleman. She was rather a handsome girl when I knew
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; drawled the Consul, &ldquo;then there is no particular reason why she
      should be anxious regarding your whereabouts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None that I am aware of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Well, are you going back to America after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t quite made up my mind what I shall do, Jimmy, except that I
      shall call at your office in the morning, and there mature my plans, with
      your assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you call at my office, you are more than likely to run against Colonel
      Beck. I expect him there bright and early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I had forgotten about the Colonel. Still, there is no hurry. I
      can drop in later, when the Colonel has moved on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All arrangements, however, bow to Chance, and Chance now intervened to
      upset their plans. A burly, florid-faced man with white moustache loomed
      up before them, and a heavy hand smote Steele on the shoulder with a force
      that made him wince and bite his lip to restrain a cry of resentment.
      &ldquo;Hallo, John, old man!&rdquo; shouted the stranger, &ldquo;I am mighty glad to see
      you. Been searching the town for you; called on that stuck-up Consul of
      ours, but he pretended he knew nothing about you. I suppose he thought I
      believed him, but the undersigned wasn&rsquo;t born yesterday, and I had met
      talented prevaricators before. Oh by Jingo! this you, Consul? I didn&rsquo;t
      notice you at first. Well, I stick to all I said. You told me this evening
      that you didn&rsquo;t know where John Steele was, and now I find you sitting
      here with him. I think, by Jingo! that you owe me an apology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe you nothing, Colonel, not even my appointment. Every man who drifts
      in on me appears to think I am indebted to him for my place. I beg to
      inform you that it is no part of a Consul&rsquo;s duty to bestow addresses upon
      any stranger who happens to ask for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Mr. Stokes,&rdquo; replied the Colonel genially, drawing up a
      chair and seating himself uninvited at their table. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the habit of
      your uncle Ben to get left, and I knew I would find Steele ultimately if
      he was in town. Say, John, you ought to be in New York nowadays. Things
      are booming there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had enough of booms,&rdquo; replied the young man without enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! It&rsquo;s absurd for a capable fellow like you, and a talented man,
      too, if I may be allowed to say so before your face, to chuck things up
      the way you&rsquo;ve done. And that reminds me, John, did you ever sell that
      block of Northern Pacific stock you had during the panic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got it yet, eh? Well, I congratulate you. Now, at the present moment that
      would form a very nice little nucleus to begin on, and you can count on me
      to help you till everything&rsquo;s blue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stock wasn&rsquo;t much of a nucleus last time I tendered it to you,
      Colonel,&rdquo; said Steele dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel threw back his head and laughed boisterously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you haven&rsquo;t forgotten that episode yet? Well, you bolted from
      Warmington so quickly that I hadn&rsquo;t any chance of giving you an
      explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No explanation was needed, Colonel Beck. You refused me the money I
      required, and were quite within your right in doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but why did I refuse you; why? Answer me that, John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, with great good nature, placed a hand lovingly upon the
      shoulder of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your conundrum is easy enough,&rdquo; replied the young man nonchalantly. &ldquo;You
      didn&rsquo;t want to let me have the money, that was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I didn&rsquo;t; certainly I didn&rsquo;t; and you should be very thankful
      to me that I refused. I knew Wall Street a great deal better than you did,
      my dear fellow, and that money would just have followed the rest into the
      pit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite believe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but you didn&rsquo;t believe me then; and you left my house in a huff,
      without ever giving me a chance to make my position clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had been anxious to make it clear, Colonel, there was plenty of
      time to do it in. That was some years ago, and a letter to Naples costs
      only five cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; cried the Colonel, in the bluff manner of an honest but
      misunderstood man. &ldquo;I might have expended the five cents, as you say, if I
      had known your address, but you had got on your high horse, and had said
      things which a younger man should have hesitated before applying to his
      elder. Now, I don&rsquo;t pretend to be any better than my fellows, and I admit
      I was offended. Such usage coming from you, John, hurt me, I confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American Consul, finding himself an unneeded third in what was
      drifting into a private discussion, pushed back his chair and rose to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must bid you good-night, Steele,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have another appointment.
      I shall see you at the office tomorrow, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Stokes. The Colonel and I have nothing confidential to
      discuss,&rdquo; returned his friend, while the Colonel sat silent, as if he
      thought this was not a true statement of the case. The Consul, however,
      persisted in his withdrawal, and Colonel Beck heaved a sigh of relief as
      he watched him disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy,&rdquo; continued the Colonel, in a tone of tender regret, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think you treated your friends very well. I don&rsquo;t think you should have
      jumped at the wrong conclusion as quickly as you did. I would willingly
      have let you have the money if I had not known it was certain to go where
      the rest of your cash had gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite possible I was mistaken, Colonel; I always was rather
      hot-headed, and if in this case I made an error, I now offer apology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hurt me, it hurt me at the time,&rdquo; murmured the Colonel in reminiscent
      tones; &ldquo;but if only myself were involved, I would never have said a word.
      I am a man of the world, and am accustomed to the ups and downs of the
      world. I make no pretence that your silent desertion caused me permanent
      grief. I resented your impetuous action, but would never have spoken if no
      one else had been concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one else concerned? I do not understand you. Who else was concerned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to speak frankly, as between man and man, I think you treated my
      niece Sadie rather badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You astonish me, Colonel. I never treated any woman badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been all my life a very busy man,&rdquo; rejoined the Colonel, with more
      of severity in his tone than had hitherto been the case, &ldquo;and I frankly
      admit that much went on in my own household of which I was not cognisant.
      During the first months of our acquaintance you visited us somewhat
      frequently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it? This much of it, that I did not know until you had left that
      the affections of my niece were centred upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite mistaken, Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say there was never anything between you two but ordinary
      friendship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to say nothing of the sort. It is not a question for two men to
      discuss; but since you have broached the subject, I may tell you what you
      probably know already, that the last interview I had in your house was
      with your niece. She received me with great coolness and parted from me
      without visible regret. To put it quite plainly, Colonel Beck, the niece
      seemed to share the uncle&rsquo;s feelings regarding me. Financially, I was
      broken, and consequently was of no further use either to man or woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stout Colonel placed the tips of his fingers together over the most
      corpulent portion of his person, raised his eyes to the ceiling, and drew
      a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hasty young friend, I see exactly what happened. You left me enraged
      because I refused to lend you money. You said to yourself, &lsquo;This man in a
      crisis declines to befriend me.&rsquo; That was no state of mind in which to
      visit a young lady proud and sensitive. Something in your manner must have
      jarred upon her. Girls are of finer texture than we brutal men. Her
      seeming coldness was merely offended dignity, and you left her presence
      under a misapprehension, as, indeed, you left mine. She expected your
      return, but you never came back. It was long before I even suspected that
      anything was wrong between you two, but I knew that Sadie had received
      offer after offer of marriage, some of them most advantageous, but all
      proposals she rejected. The utmost confidence existed between us. She is
      to me as if she were my own daughter. I expostulated with her one day, and
      to my surprise she burst into tears and then confessed her preference for
      you. I must say that for a time I was filled with resentment against you,
      but this feeling gave way to sorrow at seeing my girl waste her life
      through misplaced love. I have spoken to you with the utmost frankness.
      Sadie is dearer to me than everything else in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some moments after the Colonel finished his exposition of the case
      John Steele maintained silence. The Viennese band was playing a lively
      selection, and he appeared to be listening to the music, but with troubled
      brow. The place seemed rather unsuited for a confession of love, and the
      tidings brought no particular joy to the listener. At last the young man
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Miss Beck know&mdash;was she aware that you were going to speak to
      me on this subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. I doubt if she would thank me for my interference,
      because, as I said before, she is a proud girl. I don&rsquo;t think she knew you
      were in Naples until she heard me ask the Consul about you. When I was
      questioning him, she seemed rather eager to hear his answers, but she said
      nothing until we were outside.&rdquo; This coincided with the account given by
      Stokes of the visit, and Steele became more and more perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say when you were outside?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! she wanted to know why I wished to see you, and I told her it was on
      a matter of business. This didn&rsquo;t quite satisfy her, so, being pressed, I
      mentioned that block of Northern Pacific stock which you offered to sell
      to me once, and said I thought I could dispose of it for you to advantage,
      if you still possessed it. Sadie knows nothing of Wall Street affairs, so,
      of course, this explanation seemed quite reasonable. Besides, it is true
      enough, for I do wish to make a bargain with you about that stock whenever
      you feel inclined to come down from the clouds and discuss mundane
      affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect me to do? I don&rsquo;t mean about the stock, but about Miss
      Beck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not for me to make any suggestions in the premises, my dear fellow.
      You are a man of honour. You have made a mistake which involves the
      happiness of an innocent person. I have put the matter before you with a
      plainness which is, I think, exceptional. The next move must rest with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you stopping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Grand Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, with your permission, I shall have the pleasure of calling upon
      Miss Beck to-morrow afternoon at four o&rsquo;clock, if that hour is
      convenient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stout Colonel, with visible emotion, clasped Steele warmly by the
      hand. &ldquo;You are a good fellow!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When you meet my niece, you will
      let no hint escape you of this conversation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most assuredly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to see you,&rdquo; continued the Colonel, &ldquo;about the Northern Pacific
      stock, remember that, and, of course, you call on her for old friendship&rsquo;s
      sake on learning she is here with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may rely upon my tact, Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mission accomplished, the Colonel seemed to hesitate between going or
      staying, his attitude that of a man wondering whether it is better to
      leave well alone or to proceed further. Finally he said: &ldquo;By the way,
      Steele, in order that we may make our conference the more legitimate, how
      about that Northern Pacific stock of yours? I am willing to buy it
      outright, or to sell it for you, just as you choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not quite in a position to sell at the present moment, Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you said that you still held the stock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do, but I don&rsquo;t care to make any move regarding it just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delays are dangerous, John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know they are,&rdquo; rejoined the younger man shortly, with a finality of
      tone which showed the elder that nothing was to be gained by continuing
      the discussion; so the good man rose and bade farewell to his friend with
      a cordiality that was almost overdone, and left the other to his thoughts,
      such as they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Steele enjoyed little sleep that night. The ghost of an almost
      forgotten love haunted him, and the apparition, as is usually the case,
      was most unwelcome. He had certainly left the girl with brusque
      abruptness, thoroughly convinced that she was as mercenary as her uncle,
      ready to throw him over because he had failed financially. At that time he
      had possessed the eager confidence of extreme youth; now, it occurred to
      him that he had often been mistaken in his estimates of people. Might not
      an error have been committed in this case? The manner of Colonel Beck
      retained its ancient bluff heartiness, and there was certainly a show of
      reasonableness in his presentation of the case. Time had long since
      mitigated the sting of the refusal. At the moment of asking he had
      supposed that the granting of the loan meant salvation. The continuance of
      the panic, however, convinced him that the money would have melted
      ineffectually and vanished like the rest. If his estimate of the situation
      had been so far astray, might not his judgment of both uncle and niece
      have been equally erroneous? There was but one thing for a man of honour
      to do, and that was to stand the brunt of his mistake, no matter what the
      cost. He was not the first to pay, with interest compounded, an early
      debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day the problem presented no more alluring aspect than it had done
      during the troublesome night. As the hour of the interview approached,
      Steele&rsquo;s dejection increased. He did not visit the Consul as he had
      promised. In fact, he had entirely forgotten the appointment made the
      night before. He walked along the promenade by the sea-wall fronting the
      fashionable quarter of Naples, with haggard face and bowed head, striving
      to collect his thoughts, although, so far, those he had succeeded in
      collecting proved of little comfort to him. However, the hour was set,
      and, as it approached, he walked resolutely to the Grand Hotel to meet the
      girl, in a frame of mind almost as greatly perturbed as when he last saw
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time had passed lightly over the blonde head of Miss Sadie Beck, who
      greeted him with subdued sweetness; a touch of melancholy in her voice. As
      the Consul had very truly said, Miss Beck was an amazingly pretty girl,
      who dressed with an elegance that suggested Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through a chance meeting with your uncle last evening, I learned that you
      were in Naples, and I asked permission to call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he told me he had met you,&rdquo; replied the girl simply. &ldquo;It gives me
      great pleasure to see you again, because, if you remember, we parted
      rather in anger,&rdquo; and Sadie raised her blue eyes to his, only to sink them
      again to the carpet with just the slightest possible indication of a
      little quivering sigh; indeed, the eyes themselves, large and pathetic,
      gave token of unshed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Beck&mdash;&rdquo; he began, but she interrupted him in tremulous tones; a
      crystal drop actually became visible on the long eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the old days you used to call me Sadie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the old days are gone forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were his last effort against the silken web which he felt
      entangling him, and he knew himself to be a brute for uttering them. Their
      effect upon the girl was instantaneous. She sank down by the table, flung
      her arms upon it, lowering her face upon them in a storm of weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! not for me! not for me!&rdquo; she cried between sobs. &ldquo;You may forget the
      old days, and I see you have forgotten them. Leave me, then! leave me to
      my memories! Why, oh why did you seek to see me again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That settled it. He placed his hand upon her heaving shoulders and spoke
      soothingly to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Steele came out of the hotel and went direct to the
      American Consulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, old man! what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; cried James Stokes. &ldquo;You are
      white as a ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right. Didn&rsquo;t sleep very well last night. See here, Stokes! I
      just called to say that I wish you would forget part of the conversation
      we had yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily done! Which part, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I said with reference to Colonel Beck. I was mistaken about him. He
      has convinced me of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! has he? You mean, then, he didn&rsquo;t refuse you the twenty thousand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He refused it from the best of motives. I was rather a strenuous fool in
      those days, and thought everything should come my way. If I didn&rsquo;t see
      what I wanted, I imagined all I had to do was to ask for it. I left the
      Colonel in a temper, and I realise now that I did worthy people a great
      injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one else was involved, then, as well as the Colonel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I was engaged to his niece, and, as there is no secret about it, I
      may as well inform you that the engagement has been renewed to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Consul whistled and then checked himself, as if this indication of
      surprise were not quite appropriate to so serious an announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, John, I congratulate you. She is a very handsome girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extremely so,&rdquo; answered the happy man, as he gloomily and abruptly took
      his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frivolous Consul was now at liberty to whistle as long as he liked,
      and he did so. Then he took to muttering to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t admire the position of affairs a little bit. My friend John
      resembles a man who&rsquo;s just got a life sentence. He was thunderstruck when
      I mentioned Beck to him last night, and quite evidently didn&rsquo;t wish me to
      leave him alone with the Colonel. I distrust the Beck contingent. By St.
      Jonathan, I&rsquo;ll try a little ruse with the gallant Colonel, which at least
      can do no harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friendly Stokes pondered deeply over the situation, until his
      meditations were interrupted by the entrance of the Colonel himself. He
      had come in quest of letters, for the Consulate was
      post-office-in-ordinary to various tourists from the States.
    </p>
    <p>
      No letters bearing the name of Beck had arrived, and the inquirer was
      turning away when Stokes acted with quick heedlessness, which must be the
      excuse for what followed. In his own defence he used to say afterward that
      the presence of Colonel Beck so corrupted him with an atmosphere of Wall
      Street, that he couldn&rsquo;t speak the truth if he tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Colonel, one moment. You are an old friend of Steele&rsquo;s, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel turned on his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to speak with you a moment about him, if you don&rsquo;t mind. I&rsquo;m an
      old friend of his, too, but unfortunately I&rsquo;m poor, and so, however
      willing, I can&rsquo;t be of much assistance to him. Did he speak to you last
      night about money matters after I left you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Colonel, drawing down his brows. &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s just like him.
      I came away to give him the opportunity. I owe you an apology for my
      attitude when you first came to the Consulate. Of course, I knew Steele&rsquo;s
      address, but I thought you might be a creditor of his, and goodness knows
      the poor fellow has had enough of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you mean? If he owns that Northern Pacific stock, he&rsquo;s a
      rich man, richer than you have any idea of, if he sells at once. He can
      realise millions on that stock at the present moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he hasn&rsquo;t told you what he did with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ruddy face of the Colonel seemed to become mottled, and he moistened
      his lips as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What has he done with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in spite of all my advice, he sent it over to a friend named Philip
      Manson in New York. He hasn&rsquo;t even a scrap of writing to show for it. You
      know Wall Street, so I need say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel apparently knew Wall Street, for he gasped: &ldquo;The eternal
      fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Still, Steele&rsquo;s a good fellow, and we mustn&rsquo;t let him sink. I
      thought, perhaps, you wouldn&rsquo;t mind stumping up a bit to help him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he any other resources?&rdquo; asked the Colonel. &ldquo;Not a cent, so far as
      I know. All his hopes were centred on that Northern Pacific stock, and now
      that&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must say, Mr. Consul, that you have a good deal of cheek to ask
      me, a complete stranger to you, to spend money on an idiot who doesn&rsquo;t
      know enough to take care of a fortune when he has got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele passed another unrefreshing night, but solace came next
      morning in the shape of an early letter and an important cablegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Mr. Steele (the letter began).</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>How inscrutable is the human heart! Ever since you left America I have
      yearned to see you, and at last this desire was gratified. You were the
      idol of my younger days, and were my first love&mdash;my first and only
      love, I may say; and yet I write these words as calmly as if I were
      inditing an order to my dressmaker. I find what I should have known
      before, that we cannot light a fire with a heap of ashes. I know you will
      think me wayward and changeable, especially after my emotion when you
      spoke of the olden days. But am I to blame that I find myself changed, and
      fancy I see a change in you also? There can never be anything between us,
      John, but that pure friendship which becomes more and more of a solace as
      we grow older. I give you back your promise of to-day. It will be useless
      to call upon me, for my uncle and I will have left for Rome before you
      receive this letter. But believe me,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Always your friend and well-wisher,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sadie Beck.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by Jove!&rdquo; cried the astounded man, as he finished the epistle. &ldquo;The
      girl is honest, after all, and I have not been able to conceal my real
      feeling towards her. I am afraid I have kept faith in the letter, but not
      in the spirit. However, thank God for her decision! Her letter does not
      betray a broken heart, even if I had conceit enough to think I had caused
      her suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a jubilant man who called upon the Consul in his office that
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any thing new this morning, Steele? You seem brighter than I have seen
      you look for a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rather important news. It seems to be my fate to come into this
      office and contradict what I said the day before, so I am at it again. The
      Becks have left suddenly for Rome, and the young lady jilts me, so that
      engagement is off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! What is the reason of their change of plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No reason at all, so far as I can make out. Surely a woman doesn&rsquo;t need
      to give a reason for preferring Rome to Naples?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I suppose not,&rdquo; murmured the Consul, wondering how much his hint that
      John was a ruined man had to do with the sudden withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve had a most important cablegram from Philip Manson,&rdquo; continued
      John jubilantly. &ldquo;He has sold out my Northern Pacific at a price which
      more than recoups me for all my losses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, you&rsquo;re a good deal merrier than you were this time yesterday. I
      expect the next announcement to be that you are returning to the States,
      to leave me here lamenting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it exactly. But there&rsquo;s no law compelling you to stay here when
      there&rsquo;s ten thousand patriotic citizens eager to take your place. Manson
      has been appointed general manager of the Wheat Belt Line, with offices in
      Chicago, and he offers me my old position of division superintendent, so
      I&rsquo;ll be singing that &lsquo;Fare-well to Naples&rsquo; which I&rsquo;ve heard so often since
      I arrived here. Jimmy, I&rsquo;m going to be a sane and useful citizen
      hereafter. No more stock exchange for me. I shall plant my money in
      gilt-edged mortgages where the interest will be as secure as the eternal
      hills. Then I&rsquo;ll settle down to hard work and show old Philip Manson what
      an industrious person can do on the Wheat Belt Line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele arrived in America to learn that it was easier to make good
      resolutions than to keep them. He settled down in Chicago and found there
      was little difficulty in placing his money on mortgage at attractive rates
      of interest. He gave, however, his personal care to the securities
      offered, trusted no man&rsquo;s word, and always viewed the spot and made close
      inquiries before he drew a cheque for investment. He divided his money
      between city and country, not depending on any one lawyer to do the
      business for him, but seeking local advice and local watchfulness wherever
      a mortgage was drawn. His eggs were in many baskets, or hatching nests,
      with a different legal hen to sit on each. The only gentleman of the law
      he had heretofore known was Beck, and his opinion of the profession seemed
      to be tinctured by his dislike of the gallant Colonel. He gave work to
      many legal experts, but never allowed the left-hand lawyer to know what
      the right-hand lawyer was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shocked to find himself so suspicious of everyone except Philip
      Manson, but even more perturbed to learn that all his old delight in work
      was gone. Philip Manson was ambitious to make the Wheat Belt Line the
      model railway of the West, and in his quiet intense purposeful way was
      accomplishing that object. To John this ambition seemed trivial and above
      all futile, when it was possible for some speculator in New York or a
      combination of speculators to make the road a mere pawn in a gamble; to
      wreck it if its ruin suited the game, to discharge every employee at a
      week&rsquo;s notice. His liking for Manson, his reluctance to disillusionise the
      one man on earth who was friend and believed in him, held him for more
      than a year at his task of division superintendent and the work that was
      growing more and more irksome to him. Then an incident at Slocum Junction
      gave the necessary impetus which finally shifted him from a career of
      usefulness into the predatory class. The faithful watch-dog became the
      ravenous wolf.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;BUYING A RAILWAY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE station-master
      said nonchalantly that he had nothing to do with it, and from out the
      telegraph office he brought a stout wooden chair which he set down in the
      dark strip of shade which ran along the pine platform under the eaves of
      the station. The back of this chair being tilted against the building, the
      station-master sat down in it, put his heels on the wooden round, took
      from his pocket a jack-knife, and began to whittle a stick, an occupation
      which the momentary pausing of the express seemed to have interrupted.
      There was nothing of the glass of fashion or the mould of form about the
      station-master. He was dressed in weather-worn trousers, held to his thin
      frame by a pair of suspenders quite evidently home-made, which came over
      his shoulders, and underneath this was a coarse woollen shirt, open at the
      throat because the button had gone. On top of all this there perched a
      three-year-old, dilapidated straw hat which had once possessed a wide
      brim, but was now in a state of disrepair in thorough keeping with the
      costume. Yet in spite of appearances he was a capable young man who could
      manipulate a telegraphic machine at reasonable speed, was well up in the
      business pertaining to Slocum Junction, and had definite opinions
      regarding the manner in which the affairs of the nation should be carried
      on. Indeed, at that moment he was an exemplification of the independence
      for which his country had fought and bled. No one knew better than he that
      the Greased Lightning Express would never have halted for an instant at
      Slocum Junction unless it did so to put off a person of some importance.
      But that important person had begun to give his opinion of the locality in
      language that was painful and free the moment he realised the situation,
      and the station-master signified his resentment by sitting down in the
      chair and assuming a careless attitude, which told the stranger plainer
      than words that he could go to the devil if he wished. For all he knew,
      the obstreperous person who had stepped from the express might be his
      chief, but the station-master made no concession to this possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite him in the blazing sunlight stood a dapper young man grasping a
      neat handbag. He might have posed as a tailor&rsquo;s model, and he offered a
      striking contrast to the unkempt station-master. He cast an almost
      despairing look at the vanishing express, now a mere dot in the horizon,
      with a trail of smoke, as if it were a comet that had run aground. Then he
      turned an exasperated face upon the nonchalant station-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not responsible for the situation, eh? You don&rsquo;t seem to care
      much, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to tell the truth, stranger, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to tell me there&rsquo;s no train for two hours and a half on the
      branch line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said anything of the sort, because there isn&rsquo;t any branch line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No branch line? Why, there it is before my eyes! There&rsquo;s a locomotive, of
      a kind, and a composite passenger and freight-car that evidently dates
      from the time of the Deluge. Noah used that car!&rdquo; cried the angry
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if Noah was here, he wouldn&rsquo;t use it for two hours and a half,&rdquo;
       said the station-master complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean,&rdquo; protested the stranger. &ldquo;Is there, or
      is there not, a train in two hours and a half?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said a minute ago there wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything of the kind, and if you weren&rsquo;t adding your own
      natural heat to the unnatural heat of the day, you&rsquo;d learn something. You
      were talking about branch lines; I said there is no branch line. That&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the meaning of those two lines of rust running to the right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s five or six thousand people,&rdquo; droned the station-master, &ldquo;who&rsquo;d
      like to know what that object you&rsquo;re referring to really is. Leastways,
      they used to want to know, but lately they&rsquo;ve given up all curiosity on
      the subject. They&rsquo;re the shareholders, who put up good money to have that
      road made. We call it the Farmers&rsquo; Road, and it isn&rsquo;t a branch, but as
      independent as the main line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or as yourself,&rdquo; hazarded the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s independent, anyhow,&rdquo; continued the station-master, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve
      nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the cursed fools who own it the sense to make it connect with
      anything on the main line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, we&rsquo;re all fools unless we come from Chicago,&rdquo; said the
      station-master imperturbably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; commented the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <i>I</i> did. If your dome of thought was in working order, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t need to explain these things; but as I&rsquo;ve nothing particular to
      do, I may as well teach a man from Chicago his ABC. You stepped off the
      express just now owning the whole country, populated with fools, according
      to you. I&rsquo;ve been station-master here for eighteen months, and I never saw
      that express stop before. I may be an idiot, but still I am aware that a
      man who steps off the Greased Lightning is one of two things. He is either
      a bigbug with pull enough on the railway company to get them to stop the
      Greased Lightning for him, or else he&rsquo;s a tramp who can&rsquo;t pay his fare,
      and so is put off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve sized me up, have you? Well, which am I? The millionaire or
      the tramp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you stepped off, I thought you were the millionaire; but the moment
      you opened your mouth, I knew you were the tramp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele laughed with very good-natured heartiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, old man, that&rsquo;s all right. The drinks are on me, if there were a
      tavern near, which there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be. I suppose there&rsquo;s no place in
      this God-forsaken hole where on a hot day like this a man can get a
      cooling beverage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger, you&rsquo;re continually jumping at conclusions and landing at the
      wrong spot. Allow me to tell you&rdquo;&mdash;here he lowered his voice a bit&mdash;&ldquo;that
      you don&rsquo;t raise no blush to my cheeks by anything you can say; but there&rsquo;s
      a lady in the waiting-room, and if I were you I&rsquo;d talk accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The change in the cocksure attitude of John Steele was so sudden and
      complete that it brought a faint smile of gratification to the gaunt face
      of the station-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; whispered the crestfallen young man, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you tell
      me that before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve been kind of monopolising the conversation, and I haven&rsquo;t
      had much chance to speak up to now. One would suppose that if a man had a
      thinking-machine in his head at all, he would know that the little road
      couldn&rsquo;t connect with a train that never stopped here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; said John hurriedly, his mind running on the
      language he had used in the first moments of chagrin at finding himself
      marooned at this desolate junction, which might have been heard by the
      unseen lady in the waiting-room. He hoped his voice hadn&rsquo;t carried through
      the pine wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, station-master, I apologise. And now, if you will kindly tell me
      what the Farmers&rsquo; Road <i>does</i> connect with, I&rsquo;ll be very much
      obliged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Farmers&rsquo; Road runs two trains a day,&rdquo; said the station-master
      sententiously, as if he were speaking of some mighty empire. &ldquo;The train
      consists, as you see, of a locomotive and a mixed car. The first train
      comes in here at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, connecting with the local
      going east. It then returns to Bunkerville, and reaches here in the
      afternoon at three o&rsquo;clock, to connect with the local going west. That
      little train doesn&rsquo;t know there are any flyers on our line; all it knows
      is that the eastern local comes in somewhere about nine o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning, and the western local arrives anywhere between three and five in
      the afternoon. So a Chicago man can&rsquo;t step jauntily off the express he has
      managed to stop, and expect to get a train to Bunkerville whenever he
      chooses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirably stated,&rdquo; said John Steele. &ldquo;And if you will condescend further
      to enlighten a beclouded intellect would you mind explaining what the
      deuce the little train is doing here at this hour? If I follow your
      argument, it should have returned to Bunkerville after the nine o&rsquo;clock
      local came in, arriving here again just before three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your befogged brain is waking up,&rdquo; said the station-master encouragingly.
      &ldquo;The phenomenon to which you have called attention happens once or twice a
      week. If you cast your eye to the other end of the platform, you will see
      piled there an accumulation of miscellaneous freight. The Farmers&rsquo; Road
      has just dumped that upon us, and to do so has taken a special trip. That
      stuff will go east on Number Eight, which is a freight train that will
      stop here some time in the afternoon when it sees the signal set against
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I comprehend,&rdquo; said Steele; &ldquo;and I venture on my next proposition with
      great diffidence, caused by increasing admiration of yourself and the
      lucid mind you bring to bear on Western railway procedure. If I have
      followed your line of argument as unerringly as the farmers&rsquo; train follows
      the Farmers&rsquo; Road, his nibs the engineer must take the train back to
      Bunkerville so that he may return here on his regular trip to meet the
      three o&rsquo; clock western local. If I am right, what is to prevent him from
      going now, taking me with him, and giving me an opportunity at Bunkerville
      to transact my business and catch the regular train back?&mdash;for I am
      going further west, and would like to intercept the local, which would
      save me spending an unnecessary night at Bunkerville, and wasting most of
      to-morrow as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reasons are as follows: His nibs, as you call him, is engineer,
      conductor, brakeman, and freight handler. When he came in, he had to carry
      that freight from his car to the platform where you see it. That takes
      time, even if the day were not so oppressively hot as it is. So, instead
      of keeping up his fire under the boiler, and burning useless coal, he
      banks the furnace as soon as he arrives. Then, at his leisure, he removes
      the boxes to the platform. If he returned to Bunkerville, they would give
      him something to do there; here he is out of reach; besides, he would have
      to draw his fires and start anew about two o&rsquo;clock, and that he doesn&rsquo;t
      want to do. He has, therefore, curled himself up in the passenger car, put
      a newspaper over his face to keep off the flies, and has gone to sleep.
      When the proper moment arrives he will stir up his fire, go to
      Bunkerville, and then be ready to make the return trip on one expenditure
      of coal. <i>Now</i> do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you, I do; and this has given me an idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good thing, and I can easily guess what your idea is. But before
      putting it into operation, I should like to mitigate a slight you have put
      on Slocum Junction. You made a sarcastic remark about cool drinks. Now, I
      beg to inform you that the nine o&rsquo;clock local from the west slides off on
      this here platform every morning a great big square cold chunk of ice.
      That chunk of ice is growing less and less in a big wooden pail in the
      telegraph-office, but the water that surrounds it is chilly as the North
      Pole. If you have anything in your hip pocket or in that natty little
      valise which mitigates the rigour of cold water, there&rsquo;s no reason why you
      shouldn&rsquo;t indulge in a refreshing drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Station-master,&rdquo; said John, laughing, &ldquo;you ought to be superintendent of
      this road, instead of junction boss. You&rsquo;re the wisest man I&rsquo;ve met in two
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, he sprang the catch of the handbag and drew forth a bulky,
      wicker-covered, silver-topped flask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I propose we adjourn to the telegraph-office,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and investigate
      that wooden pail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The station-master led the way with an alacrity that he had not heretofore
      exhibited. The result of the conference was cheerful and comforting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the station-master, drawing the back of his hand across his
      lips, &ldquo;what you want is a special train to Bunkerville. A man from the
      city would get that by telegraphing to the superintendent at the terminus
      and paying twenty dollars. A man from the country who had some sense would
      go to Joe the engineer and persuade him he ought to wake up and return to
      Bunkerville at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much would be required to influence Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a couple of dollars would be wealth. A silver dollar in front of each
      eye will obscure the whole Western prairie if placed just right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll go out and place &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are forgetting your flask,&rdquo; said the station-master, as Steele
      snapped shut his valise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not. That flask and its contents belong to you, as a reward for
      being patient and instructive when a darned fool let loose from the city
      happened your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this showed John Steele to be a reader of his fellow-man; for while
      the engineer might accept the two dollars, the independent station-master
      certainly would not have done so. That glib official, however, seemed to
      have no particular words for this occasion, so he changed the subject and
      said: &ldquo;If you persuade Joe to go, I wish you&rsquo;d remember the lady in the
      waiting-room. She&rsquo;s a Miss Dorothy Slocum, and a powerful nice girl, that
      teaches school in Bunkerville. Fact is, this junction was named after her
      father. Used to be the principal man round these parts; but he lost his
      money, and now his girl&rsquo;s got to teach school. I never knew him&mdash;he
      was dead long before I came here. She&rsquo;s been visiting relatives. This is
      vacation time, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. You tell her there&rsquo;s a special leaving in a few minutes, and
      that she&rsquo;s very welcome to ride upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that John Steele went out into the furnace of the sun across the
      dusty road and entered the composite car. The Farmers&rsquo; Road did not join
      rails with the main line, and so caused much extra handling of freight.
      The engine stood there simmering in the heat, both external and internal,
      a slight murkiness of smoke rising from its funnel, shaped like an
      inverted bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Joe!&rdquo; cried Steele, as he entered the car. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you yearn for
      home and friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was sprawling on two seats, with a newspaper over his head, as the
      station-master had predicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he echoed, sitting up and shaking away the sheet of paper,
      &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, except that if the spirit should move you to get over to
      Bunkerville with this ancient combination, five dollars will be
      transferred from my pocket into yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nough said,&rdquo; cried Joe, rising to his feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take me about twenty
      minutes to get the pot boiling again. You don&rsquo;t happen to have the fiver
      about you, I suppose? I haven&rsquo;t seen one for a couple of years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; replied Steele, drawing a crisp bill from his purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer thrust it into the pocket of his greasy overalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll toot the whistle when I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This financial operation accomplished, John Steele returned to the
      station. The station-master was standing by the door of the waiting-room
      conversing pleasantly with someone within. When Steele entered the room he
      was amazed to see so pretty a girl sitting on the bench that ran round the
      bare walls of the uninviting apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you introduce me?&rdquo; inquired the city man, handing his card to the
      station-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dorothy Slocum,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;this is Mr. John Steele, of
      Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man removed his fashionable straw hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Slocum,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I desire to apologise to you. I&rsquo;m afraid that
      when I found myself stranded on the platform outside, I used language
      which can hardly be justified, even in the circumstances. But I had no
      idea at the time that there was a lady within miles of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was much interested in my book,&rdquo; replied the girl, with a smile, &ldquo;and
      was not paying attention to what was going on outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held up the volume, between whose leaves her fore-finger was placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Slocum, it must have been a pretty absorbing story, and I am
      deeply grateful to it for acting as a non-conductor between my impulsive
      observations and your hearing. Nothing excuses intemperate language, as
      the station-master here has taught me through the force of a benign
      example. Still, if anything could exculpate a man, I should think it would
      be the exasperating conduct of this Farmers&rsquo; Railroad, as they call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Miss Dorothy archly, &ldquo;the book had really no right to
      interfere, because I am one of the owners of the railway, and so perhaps
      it was my duty to listen to complaints of a passenger. Not that I have
      anything to do with the management of the line; I am compelled to pay my
      fare just like the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted if you accept a ride on your own road as free as if
      you carried a superintendent&rsquo;s pass. I am going to Bunkerville in my own
      private car, as it were, and shall feel honoured if I may extend the
      courtesies of the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The station-master has just told me you were kind enough to offer a poor
      vagrant a lift to Bunkerville. I wished to buy a ticket, but this haughty
      official of the main line so despises our poor little road that he will
      not sell me one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the station-master, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the power, nor the tickets.
      They don&rsquo;t entrust me with any business so tremendous. Joe starts his
      rickety engine going, then leaves it to jog along as it likes, and comes
      through the car to collect the fares. They have no tickets, and perhaps
      that&rsquo;s why the road has never paid a dividend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; protested the girl. &ldquo;Poor Joe has not got rich
      out of his occupation, any more than the shareholders have made money on
      their shares. If you will permit me to pay my fare to Joe, Mr. Steele I
      shall be only too happy to take this early opportunity of getting to
      Bunkerville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of it, Miss Slocum; in fact, I must prohibit any
      communication between Joe and yourself, fearing you, as an owner of the
      road, may learn by what corrupt practices I induced Joe to make the trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed, but before she could reply, a wheezy
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toot-toot!&rdquo; outside announced that Joe had already got steam up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry your valise across,&rdquo; said the obliging station-master, while
      Miss Dorothy Slocum picked up her lighter belongings and accompanied Mr.
      John Steele to the shabby little passenger-car. Joe was leaning out of the
      cab with a grin on his smeared face, which was there probably because of
      the five-dollar bill in his trousers&rsquo; pocket. The station-master placed
      the valise in the baggage section of the car, and raised his tattered hat
      as the little train started gingerly out for the open country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pretty landscape through which they passed, with little to
      indicate that the prairies were so near at hand. The line ran along a
      shallow valley, well wooded, especially by the banks of the stream that
      wandered through it, which even at this parched season of the year was
      still running its clear-water course, and Miss Slocum informed the Chicago
      man that it flowed from a never-drying spring some ten miles on the other
      side of the main line. The little road was as crooked as possible, for the
      evident object of its constructors had been to avoid bridging the stream,
      piling up any high embankments or excavating deep cuttings. The pace,
      therefore, was exceedingly slow; nevertheless John Steele did not find the
      time hang heavily on his hands. At first the girl seemed somewhat shy and
      embarrassed to find herself the only passenger except this gallant young
      business man; but he tactfully put her at her ease by pretending much
      interest in the history of the railway, with which he soon learned she was
      unfortunately familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the building of this road was the greatest financial
      disaster that ever occurred in this section of the country. My father was
      one of its chief promoters. When the Wheat Belt Line, by which you came
      here from Chicago, was surveyed through this part of the State, those
      interested in the neighbourhood expected it to run through Bunkerville,
      which would thus become a large town. The railway people demanded a large
      money bonus, which Bunker County refused, because Bunkerville was in the
      direct line, and they thought the railway must come through there, whether
      a bonus were paid or not. In fact, the first survey passed just north of
      Bunkerville. But our poor little village was not so important as its
      inhabitants imagined, and the next line surveyed was twenty miles away.
      For once the farmers were too shrewd. They thought, as they put it, that
      the new line was a bluff, and did not realise their mistake until too
      late. My father had been in favour of granting the bonus, but he was
      out-voted. Perhaps that is why the railway people called their station
      Slocum instead of Bunkerville, which was twenty miles distant. The next
      nearest railway line was forty-five miles away, and two years after the
      Wheat Belt Line began operations, it was proposed to organise a local
      company to construct a railway from Slocum, through Bunkerville to
      Jamestown, on the other line. Bonuses were granted all along the route,
      and besides this the State legislature gave a subsidy, and, furthermore,
      passed a bill to prevent competition, prohibiting any railway to parallel
      the Farmers&rsquo; Road for sixty miles on either side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that law still stand on the statute books of the State?&rdquo; asked
      Steele, with increasing interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. It has never been repealed to my knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should doubt its being constitutional. Why, that ties up more
      than seven thousand square miles of the State into a hard knot, and
      prevents it from acquiring the privilege of further railway
      communication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a measure it does,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;You may run as many lines as you
      like north and south, but not east and west.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder the Wheat Belt Line didn&rsquo;t contest that law,&rdquo; said Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been told that this law is entirely in the interests of the
      Wheat Belt Line, although the farmers didn&rsquo;t think so when they voted for
      the Bill. You see, the Wheat Belt Line was already in operation east and
      west, and could not be affected by that Act, and, of course, the same Bill
      which prevented competition to the Farmers&rsquo; Road also, in a measure,
      protected the Wheat Belt Line through the same district.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Steele, his eyes glistening, &ldquo;this is a proposition which
      contains some peculiar points. Well, go on, what happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, disaster happened. In spite of the legislation and bonuses, the road
      was a complete failure, and ruined all who were deeply interested in it.
      The farmers subscribed stock to the amount of something like a hundred
      thousand dollars, but this money, with the sum of the legislative grant
      and the bonuses, was all swallowed up in the first twenty miles, and in
      getting the rolling-stock and equipment, such as it is. The line was never
      pushed through to Jamestown, and there arose litigation about some of the
      bonuses that had been paid, and, all in all, it was a most disastrous
      business. It was hoped that the Wheat Belt Line would come to the rescue
      and buy the unfinished road, but they would not look at it. This section
      has never paid a dividend, and is supposed to be doing well when it earns
      enough money for expenses and repairs. The shares can now be bought for
      five cents on the dollar, or less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much of it do you possess, Miss Slocum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I own a thousand shares, and my father told me not to part with them,
      because he was certain that some day they would be valuable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments there was silence in the car, and the girl, glancing up
      at her companion, found his ardent gaze fixed upon her with an intensity
      that was embarrassing. She flushed slightly and turned her head to look
      out of the window at the familiar scenery they were passing. It would have
      surprised the young man could he have read the thoughts that occupied the
      mind of this extremely pretty and charmingly modest girl who sat opposite
      him. Here is practically what she said to herself: &ldquo;I am tired of this
      deadly dull village in which I live, and here, at last, is a way out. I
      read in his eyes the beginning of admiration. He shall be the youthful
      Moses to lead me into the Promised Land. Through this lucky meeting I
      shall attain the city if I but play my cards rightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would have astonished the girl if she had known what was in the man&rsquo;s
      mind. The ardent gaze was not for her, as she had supposed. Although he
      appeared to be looking directly at her, he was in reality almost ignorant
      of her presence, and saw unfolded before him a scene far beyond her&mdash;the
      whole range of the Eastern States. The power that enabled him to stop the
      fast express at Slocum Junction gave a hint of Steele&rsquo;s position in the
      railway world to the station-master, but it conveyed no meaning to the
      girl. It was his business to be intimately acquainted with the railway
      situation in northwestern America, and that involved the knowledge of what
      was going on in the Eastern States. He knew that the Rockervelt system was
      making for somewhere near this point, and that, ultimately, it would need
      to cross the State, in spite of the opposition it must meet from the Wheat
      Belt Line. Whoever possessed the Farmers&rsquo; bankrupt road held the right of
      way across the State, so far as a belt of one hundred and twenty miles was
      concerned. It seemed incredible that Rockervelt, this Napoleon of the
      railway world, should be ignorant of the obstacle that lay in his path.
      Rockervelt was in the habit of buying legislatures and crushing
      opposition; still, he never spent money where it was not required, and it
      would be infinitely cheaper to buy the Farmers&rsquo; Road, and thus secure the
      privileges pertaining to it, than to purchase the repeal of the
      obstructing law. At that moment John Steele determined to camp across the
      path of the conqueror. If Napoleon accepted battle, John was under no
      delusion as to the result. The name of Steele would disappear from the
      roll of rising young men in Chicago, and he might be forced to begin at
      the bottom of the ladder again. However, he knew that Napoleon&rsquo;s eye was
      fixed on the Pacific coast, and that he never wasted time in a fight if a
      reasonable expenditure of money would cause the enemy to withdraw. Steele
      calculated that he could control the road for something under three
      thousand dollars, which would give him the majority of the stock at the
      price the girl had named. That was a mere bagatelle. Then he would
      withdraw from Rockervelt&rsquo;s front for anything between three hundred
      thousand dollars and half a million. If he succeeded, he would at least
      recover all the money he had lost in the panic which followed the trickery
      of Rock-ervelt, Blair and Beck. But success meant more than this. Aside
      from the joy of relieving Rockervelt of a substantial sum, there would
      also follow the practical defeat of T. Acton Blair, for the Farmers&rsquo; Road
      was situated in that Western district on which the general manager was
      supposed to keep his eye, in the interests of the Rockervelt system.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sigh from the girl brought him to a realisation of his neglect of social
      duties, and the brilliant vision of loot faded from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What pretty scenery we are passing!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The wooded dell, and the
      sparkling little rivulet running through it. It is sweet and soothing
      after the rush and turmoil of a great city. It must be a delight to live
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the girl; &ldquo;it is horrid! Deadly dull, utterly
      commonplace, with little chance of improving the mind, and none at all for
      advancing one&rsquo;s material condition. I loathe the life and yearn for the
      city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she said this she bestowed upon him a fascinating glimpse of a pair of
      lovely eyes, and veiled within them he saw what he took to be a tender
      appeal for sympathy and, perhaps, for help. After all, he was a young man,
      and perhaps that glance had carried a hypnotic suggestion to his very
      soul; and, added to all this, the girl was undoubtedly beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he said, leaning forward towards her, &ldquo;I think that might be
      managed, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; she asked, looking him full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this interesting moment the car slowly came to a standstill at a wooden
      platform, and Joe thrust open the door and shouted: &ldquo;Here you are!
      Bunkerville!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy Slocum held out her hand shyly to John Steele as she bade him
      &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo; She thanked him once more for allowing her to ride on the
      special train, and added: &ldquo;If you ever come to Bunkerville again, I hope
      you will not forget me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget you!&rdquo; cried the enthusiastic young man. &ldquo;I think you entirely
      underrate the attractions of Bunkerville. It seems to me a lovely village.
      But I shall visit it in the near future&mdash;not because of itself, but
      for the reason that a certain Miss Dorothy lives here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this complimentary speech Miss Slocum made no reply, but she laughed
      and blushed in a manner very becoming to her, and somehow managed to leave
      an impression on Mr. Steele&rsquo;s mind that she was far from being displeased
      at the words he had uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone, the traveller asked Joe where the office of Mr.
      Hazlett, the lawyer, was situated, and being directed, he was speedily in
      the presence of the chief legal functionary that Bunkerville possessed.
      Steele had a considerable amount of money lent upon Bunkerville business
      property, and his lawyer had written him that, as times were backward,
      there arose some difficulty in persuading the debtors to meet the
      requirements of the mortgages. If the mortgages were foreclosed and the
      property sold, Hazlett did not think it would produce the money that had
      been borrowed upon it, and so Steele had informed him that he would drop
      off at Bunkerville on his way west and consult with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer had been looking for him on the regular train, and so was not
      at the station to meet him. If Hazlett had expected a visit from a hard
      old skinflint, bent on clutching his pound of financial flesh, he must
      have been somewhat surprised to greet a smiling young fellow who seemed to
      be thinking of anything but the property in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will just walk down the street,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll show you
      the buildings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented Steele, &ldquo;if it doesn&rsquo;t take too long; for I must
      catch the three o&rsquo;clock local at Slocum Junction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During their walk together Steele paid but the scantiest interest to the
      edifices pointed out to him, and the lawyer soon found he was not even
      listening to the particulars he recited so circumstantially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything about the Farmers&rsquo; Railway?&rdquo; was the question Steele
      shot at him in the midst of a score of reasons why it was better not to
      foreclose at the present moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about it,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;I have done the legal business of
      the road from its beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a list of the shareholders in existence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hold a partial list; but shares have changed hands a good deal, and
      sometimes no notification has been given me, which is contrary to law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told to-day that shares can be bought at five cents on the dollar.
      Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many shares have been sold at that price; some for less, some for more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the total number of shares?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could fifty thousand and an odd share be bought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to get control of the road? Yes, I suppose it might be done
      if you weren&rsquo;t in a hurry, and it was gone about quietly. Some farmers in
      the outlying districts refuse to sell, thinking the price of the stock
      will rise, which of course it won&rsquo;t do. Nevertheless, I imagine there
      should be no difficulty in collecting fifty thousand shares and one more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would it cost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere between three and five thousand dollars&mdash;all depending, as
      I said, on the thing being done circumspectly, for in these rural
      communities the wildest rumours get afloat, and so, if it became known
      that some one was in the market, prices would go up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have in my mind exactly the man to do the trick with discretion,
      and his name is Hazlett. I will lodge in the bank here five thousand
      dollars in your name, and I depend on you to get me at least one share
      over the fifty thousand, although, to be on the safe side, you may
      purchase at least a thousand in excess. Send the shares to me in Chicago
      as fast as you secure them, and I&rsquo;ll take care of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Steele, I shall do the best I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will return to your office now, Hazlett, and I&rsquo;ll hand you the cheque.
      In these matters it&rsquo;s just as well not to lose any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another building I want to show you, about five hundred yards
      down the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t mind it to-day. I have determined to take your advice and not
      foreclose at the present moment. Let&rsquo;s get back to your office, for I
      mustn&rsquo;t miss Joe&rsquo;s train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Steele had returned to Chicago, shares in the Farmers&rsquo; Railroad
      began to drop in on him in bulky packages, which he duly noted and placed
      in a safe. Presently the packages became smaller and smaller, but as the
      total had already reached forty-nine thousand six hundred and thirty,
      Steele was not alarmed until he received the following letter from
      Hazlett:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Mr. Steele:
    </p>
    <p>
      About two weeks ago I became suspicious that somebody else was buying
      shares of the Farmers. Road. I came across at that time several people who
      had sold, although they did not know to whom; and a few days ago a young
      man called upon me to know if I had any shares for sale. I told him I had
      none, and as I showed very little interest in the matter, I got some
      information, and find that a man named T. Acton Blair, of Warmington, is
      the buyer, and apparently he has agents all over the country trying to
      purchase shares. I would have telegraphed this information to you were it
      not for the fact that our telegraph-office is a little leaky, and also
      because I thought I had the game in my own hands. A young woman in this
      town, a teacher, Dorothy Slocum by name, possesses a thousand shares,
      which I felt certain I could purchase for a reasonable figure. I began at
      ten cents, but she refused, and finally raised to fifty cents, and then a
      dollar. Higher than that I could not take the responsibility of going
      without direct authority from you. To my amazement, she has informed me
      to-day that she has been offered ten thousand dollars for her stock. I
      obtained her promise that she will not sell for a week. She telegraphed
      her decision to Blair, and has received an answer from him saying he is on
      his way to see her. I learn from Miss Slocum that she is acquainted with
      you, and I surmise, without being certain, that you personally will prove
      the successful negotiator if you are on the spot. This letter should reach
      you in time to enable you to arrive here at least as soon as Blair, and I
      advise prompt action on your part if we are to secure that thousand
      shares. If you cannot come, telegraph me any one of the following words,
      and I shall understand I am authorised to offer the amount set down
      opposite that word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours most sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      James P. Hazlett.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed this a dozen words, signifying amounts from ten thousand
      dollars upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawyer Hazlett received a telegram:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Will reach Slocum Junction at twelve to-morrow. Arrange special train
      on the Farmers&rsquo; Road to Bunkerville to be at Junction.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Steele.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment Blair&rsquo;s name caught John Steele&rsquo;s eye in the lawyer&rsquo;s letter,
      he knew that Rockervelt was at last alert and of course could outbid him a
      thousand to one.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Greased Lightning Express stopped at Slocum Junction on this
      occasion, John Steele had ample time to reach the platform, because the
      express detached itself from a sumptuous private car before it pursued its
      journey further west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said John to himself, &ldquo;friend Blair travels in style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The station-master greeted Steele with the cordiality of an old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a letter which lawyer Hazlett sent out to be handed to you as
      soon as you arrived, and wished you to read it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele tore open the envelope and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I am sorry about the special train, but Blair had telegraphed from
      Warmington ordering it before your wire came. I have arranged, however,
      that Joe will return at once for you, as soon as he has landed Blair in
      Bunkerville. This will make no difference in the negotiations; Miss Slocum
      has promised to be away from home when Blair calls, and will see you
      first. I think you&rsquo;ve got the inside track, although I surmise the young
      woman is well aware that she holds the key to the situation. I don&rsquo;t know
      if she&rsquo;s after all the money she can get, or whether there is something of
      friendliness in her action. I rather suspect the latter, and I think you
      can conclude negotiations before she sees Blair at all.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yours most sincerely,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>James P. Hazlett.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      John Steele gave no expression to the annoyance he felt at missing the
      special. He distrusted the lawyer&rsquo;s optimism, and like a flash resolved to
      be in Bunkerville as soon as his antagonist. Blair had stepped down from
      his private car, asked the station-master where the special was to be
      found, and quickly ordered his car to be placed on a side track. When he
      had entered the Bunkerville composition car, and Joe had started up his
      wheezy engine, Steele darted from the shadow of the station, caught the
      car and sat down on the rear steps outside, well concealed from the sight
      of anyone unless that person stood by the end window. All went well until
      they were about five miles from Bunkerville, when Steele thought he
      recognised a lady&rsquo;s figure on the highway ahead, and forgetting that he
      might expose himself to the sharp eyes of Blair, he rose to his feet,
      clutched the stanchions, and leaned forward. An instant later the rear
      door was thrown open, a foot was planted energetically in the small of
      Steele&rsquo;s back, and that young man went hurtling down the embankment, head
      over heels. There were no half measures with Blair in a crisis like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steele sat up bruised and dazed, not knowing whether he was hurt
      seriously, or had escaped practically unscathed, which latter proved to be
      the case. It seemed to him, as he fell through the air, he heard a woman&rsquo;s
      scream. When he was somewhat stupidly debating whether this was real or
      imaginary, his doubts were solved by a voice he recognised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Steele, are you hurt? What a brutal thing for that stout villain
      to have done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Dorothy, you of all persons! And here was I trying to sneak
      into Bunkerville to see you first. I thought you were teaching school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on Saturdays, Mr. Steele,&rdquo; said the girl, laughing. &ldquo;I see, after
      all, you are not injured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, I think. Fortunately Joe doesn&rsquo;t run sixty miles an hour.
      Dorothy, I want you to marry me and come to Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the girl laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought you were here to buy my stock. I couldn&rsquo;t
      think of taking advantage of a proposal that had been literally shaken out
      of a man. I&rsquo;m afraid your mind is wandering a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mind was never clearer in its life. What is your answer, Dorothy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down beside him, still laughing a little. The rivulet was at their
      feet, the railway embankment behind them, the highway, shrouded by trees,
      in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we talk business first, and indulge in sentiment after,&rdquo; said the
      girl, with a roguish twinkle in her eye. &ldquo;I have been offered ten thousand
      dollars for my shares. Are you prepared to pay as much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cash down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine Mr. Blair would never have come all the way from Warmington to
      see me if he were not ready to pay a larger sum. I have therefore two
      further provisos to make. Proviso number one is that you will give me ten
      per cent, on the profits you make in this transaction. Of course, in spite
      of Mr. Hazlett&rsquo;s caution, I know there is something very large going on,
      and naturally I wish to profit by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, Miss Slocum, and I agree to the ten per cent,
      suggestion; in fact, I offered you a hundred per cent, in the beginning,
      and myself into the bargain, which proposal you have ignored. What is the
      second proviso?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am told you have a great deal of influence in railway circles in
      Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you get a good place for a capable and deserving young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. Does he understand railroading?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is the station-master at Slocum Junction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the station-master! Certainly, I should be delighted to offer him a
      good position. He is a splendid fellow, and I like him exceedingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am charmed to hear you say so,&rdquo; said Dorothy, with downcast eyes,
      pulling a flower and picking it to pieces; &ldquo;for that brings us to the
      sentiment, and I show my confidence in you and the great esteem in which I
      hold you, by telling you this strict secret&mdash;that I am engaged to be
      married to the station-master, and am anxious to get to Chicago.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;THE TERROR OF WHEAT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>OCKERVELT settled
      with John Steele by drawing his cheque for three hundred and ninety-eight
      thousand six hundred dollars, and it was the circumvented Blair himself
      who carried through the negotiations. Steele asked half a million at the
      beginning, but had made up his mind to accept three hundred thousand
      dollars. As he wished to net this sum clear, he added to it the amount he
      paid for the stock, including Miss Slocum&rsquo;s ten thousand dollars, and the
      percentage, which came to nearly forty thousand more. Then he informed
      Blair he was forced to add ten thousand dollars for that kick, which he
      did. He told Blair that he remembered the kick on an average of once a
      day, and that this thought humiliated him. Therefore he would be compelled
      to charge one hundred dollars a day for thinking of the assault while
      negotiations were pending. Whether this time-penalty hastened negotiations
      or not will never be known, but it accounts for the odd figures on the
      Rockervelt cheque, and, after paying all liabilities, Steele found himself
      with more than his minimum sum in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The station-master of Slocum Junction was given the position of travelling
      man on the Wheat Belt Line, at a salary of fifty dollars a week, which
      seemed to him princely. Miss Dorothy Slocum insisted on finishing her year
      at the Bunkerville school, but during the Christmas holidays she married
      the station-master, and they set up housekeeping in Chicago with a nice
      little bank account of nearly fifty thousand dollars. The young lady&rsquo;s
      dream of life was now realised. She enjoyed the privilege of being an
      inhabitant of the Western metropolis, in comfortable circumstances, with
      everything at her disposal that a large city had to bestow. John Steele,
      in the New Year, had the pleasure of escorting the young woman to a <i>matinee</i>,
      and when he asked her if the few weeks&rsquo; experience of Chicago had changed
      her mind regarding the delights of the place, she replied that Chicago was
      heavenly; which called up a smile to the young man&rsquo;s lips as he remembered
      the story of a Chicago man who had died and gone to the other place, and
      told an inmate thereof that his new residence was preferable to Chicago.
      But John didn&rsquo;t tell the story to his companion. He complained
      pathetically that she had broken his heart by marrying the station-master,
      but she laughed and said she had broken his heart no more than Blair had
      broken his neck by precipitating him down the railway embankment from the
      running train&mdash;which, by the way, was true enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time went on, he saw less and less of his Bunkerville friends. He was
      rising rapidly in the financial world, had resigned his position on the
      Wheat Belt Line, important as it was, and had set up an office for
      himself. The newspapers made a great deal of his encounter with old
      Rockervelt and his victory over the magnate, but Steele was a clear-headed
      man who indulged in no delusions on the score of that episode. He had
      spent some very anxious days while negotiations were pending, and no one
      knew better than he that if Rockervelt had decided to fight, it might have
      cost the great railway king more than he had paid, but Steele would have
      been bankrupt when the battle was ended. He resolved never again to combat
      a force so many thousand times stronger than himself. He would be content
      with a smaller game and less risk. John attributed the few grey hairs at
      his temple to those anxious days while Rockervelt was making up his mind,
      keeping silent and giving forth no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      But grey hairs do not necessarily bring wisdom, and so little does a man
      suspect what is ahead of him that a few tears from a pretty woman sent him
      into a contest without knowing who his adversary was, to find himself at
      last face to face with the most formidable financial foe that the world
      could offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had almost forgotten his friends from the West, when one day the young
      woman&rsquo;s card was brought up to him as he sat in his office, planning an
      aggression which was still further to augment his ever-increasing bank
      account. He looked up with a smile as Dorothy entered, but it was stricken
      from his lips when he saw how changed she was. All colour had left her
      cheeks, and her eyes were red as if with weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; he cried, springing to his feet, &ldquo;what is the matter?
      Have you been ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, with a catch in her voice, sinking into the chair he
      offered, &ldquo;but I am nearly distracted. Oh, Mr. Steele! you said once that
      the country was sweet and soothing after the turmoil of the city, and I
      told you I was tired of the country&rsquo;s dullness. It was a foolish, foolish
      remark. I wish we were back there, and done with this dreadful town!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what has happened? Is it your husband, then, who is ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;yes, he is&mdash;or, rather, yes and no; for, like myself, he is
      at his wits&rsquo; end, and doesn&rsquo;t know what to do; therefore I have come to
      seek your advice,&rdquo; and with this she broke down and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      John thought at first that her husband had been dismissed; and if that
      were the case, Steele, being no longer connected with the railway, would
      be powerless to aid. Still, he did not see why such an event should cause
      so much distress, for a young couple in good health, with fifty thousand
      dollars in the bank, are not exactly paupers, even in Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband,&rdquo; sobbed the woman at last, &ldquo;has invested everything we
      possess in wheat, and since that time the price of wheat has been falling
      steadily. Now we are on the verge of ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth did he meddle with wheat for? It is more dangerous than
      dynamite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; wept the young woman; &ldquo;but Tom thought it was sure to
      rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They always think that. How much did he purchase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One million bushels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious! Do you happen to know the price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, seventy-eight cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott! Do you mean to say that you two silly young people took on
      an obligation of seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, when you
      possess less than fifty thousand? When he made the deal, how much of a
      margin did he put up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the money he gave the broker? Ten thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then a decline of a cent a bushel would wipe that out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it did, and ever since wheat has been falling, until now it is
      seventy-four and a quarter. We have given the brokers so far thirty-seven
      thousand five hundred dollars, and if wheat drops another cent, we have
      not the money to meet the call and will lose everything. These last three
      weeks have been the most anxious time of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can well believe it. Now, what do you want me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Steele, I want you to take over this wheat. It can&rsquo;t possibly go much
      lower, and Tom says it is bound to rise. This time last year it was
      eighty-nine, and if it went up to that now we would net over a hundred
      thousand dollars. You see, you would not need to take the risk we have
      done, for we bought at seventy-eight, and you will be buying at
      seventy-four and a quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see how my taking it over would help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why if it went up to over eighty&mdash;and Tom says it is sure to do that
      before many weeks are past&mdash;you would make a good profit and could
      give us back our money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serious as was the situation John could scarcely refrain from a smile at
      such a beautiful specimen of feminine logic. Of course, if he wished to
      dabble in wheat, he could buy at seventy-four now, and if it went to
      eighty, secure the whole profit without paying anything to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Tom at home just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you ask him to call this afternoon, and we will talk the situation
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman rose and beamed on him through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am sure you two will hit upon a plan. When I told Tom this morning
      of the scheme I have just outlined to you he scoffed at me; but you see
      its feasibility, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I do. Anyhow, Tom and I will consult this afternoon about
      it, and he&rsquo;ll let you know at what decision we arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands with his visitor and was very glad to see her depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; he said to himself when the door was shut, &ldquo;how fatuously
      silly she is! And to think that a little more than a year ago I proposed
      to her! Poor girl! Beauty almost gone, too, at the first whiff of trouble.
      Still, the situation is serious enough; but it is easier to refuse a man
      than a woman. I&rsquo;ll tell Tom what I think of him when he comes. Imagine the
      cursed fool marching into Chicago like a hayseed from the backwoods, and
      losing fifty thousand dollars inside of three weeks. What he needs is a
      guardian; yet I&rsquo;d like to help the little woman, too, although I don&rsquo;t see
      how I can. I wonder if wheat&rsquo;s going any lower. Hold up, Jack, my boy,
      don&rsquo;t get thinking about the price of wheat. That way madness lies. No,
      I&rsquo;ll confine myself to giving Tom a piece of my mind when I see him which
      will make him angry, so we&rsquo;ll quarrel, and then it&rsquo;ll be easy to refuse
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock the ex-station-master of Slocum Junction was shown into
      John Steele&rsquo;s private office. His face was so gaunt and haggard that for a
      moment Steele felt sorry for him; but business is business, and sympathy
      has no place in the wheat-pit. Tom shook hands and sat down without a
      word; all his old jauntiness had left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my Christian friend,&rdquo; began Steele in his severest manner, &ldquo;when I
      was the means of getting you transferred from Slocum Junction to Chicago,
      and also had something to do towards endowing your wife-that-was-to-be
      with nearly fifty thousand dollars, hang me if I thought you would act the
      giddy farmer-come-to-town and blow it all away in the wheat-pit! God bless
      my soul! haven&rsquo;t you sense enough to know that the biggest men in Chicago
      have been crumpled up in the grain-market? How could <i>you</i> expect to
      win where the richest and shrewdest dealers in the city have failed? Don&rsquo;t
      you read the papers? Haven&rsquo;t you any brains in your head at all? Is it
      only an intellectual bluff that you are putting up before the public,
      pretending to be a man of sense? Why, a ten-year-old boy born in Chicago
      would know better! Wheat may be the staff of life when it leaves the
      flour-mill, but it&rsquo;s the cudgel of death in the speculative market!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve been told,&rdquo; said Tom quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t profited much by the telling. What in the name of all
      the saints made you speculate in wheat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t speculate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you bought a million bushels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that but speculating, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mr. Steele, are you quite done with your abuse of me? Isn&rsquo;t
      there something more that you could say? That I wear a woollen shirt, and
      haven&rsquo;t any collar; that my trousers are turned up, and there&rsquo;s mud on my
      shoes? Do you see any straw out of the farmyard on my hair? If you do, why
      don&rsquo;t you mention it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Tom,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s quite your Slocum Junction manner. I
      supposed you were up a tree&mdash;that you had bought a million bushels of
      wheat, spent thirty thousand dollars odd upon margins, and that now you
      couldn&rsquo;t carry it any longer. Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. That&rsquo;s exactly the situation. Now, are you in the frame of
      mind to listen to the biggest thing that there is in America to-day? Are
      you in a financial position to take advantage of an opportunity that may
      not recur for years? If you are, I&rsquo;ll talk to you. If not, I&rsquo;ll bid you
      &lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo; and go to someone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Tom, I&rsquo;m ready to listen, and willing to act if you can
      convince me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can convince you quick enough, but are you able to act, as well as
      ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to tell you the truth, Tom, if you mean going in for a big wheat
      speculation, I&rsquo;m able, but not willing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I wasn&rsquo;t speculating. Wheat will be over a dollar a bushel
      before three months are past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there going to be a war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but this I do know, that the wheat crop of the entire West
      is practically a failure&mdash;that is to say, late frosts this spring,
      and the wet weeks we have had since, will knock off anywhere from thirty
      to forty per cent, of the output. The Chicago wheat-pit is a pretty big
      thing, but it isn&rsquo;t the Almighty, neither is it the great and growing
      West. It can do many things, but it can&rsquo;t buck up against nature. Wheat
      now we&rsquo;ll say, is seventy-five cents a bushel, because of the belief that
      there&rsquo;s going to be an abundant crop; but if twenty-five per cent, of that
      crop fails, it means that twenty-five per cent, is going to be added to
      the present price of wheat. It means dollar wheat, that&rsquo;s what it means,
      and a man who knows this fact to-day can make unlimited millions of money
      if he&rsquo;s got the capital behind him. Of course, my mistake was in biting
      off more than I could chew. If I had gone in modestly, I could have
      carried it, and would have made a moderate profit; but I was too greedy,
      and too much afraid Chicago would learn the real state of the crops. I
      expected the news to be out long before now; but instead of that the
      papers are blowing about full crops, which either shows that they don&rsquo;t
      know what they are talking about, or there&rsquo;s a nigger in the fence
      somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you so very sure the crop&rsquo;s a partial failure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s my business to know, for one thing. I have travelled from
      Chicago clear through to the Pacific coast; south as far as wheat is
      grown; and up north into Canada. I don&rsquo;t need to ask a farmer what crop he
      expects; I can see with my own eyes the state of affairs. I was brought up
      on wheat; I ploughed the fields and sowed the grain, and I may say I was
      cradled in wheat, if you&rsquo;ll forgive a farmer&rsquo;s pun. Wheat? Why, I know all
      about wheat on the field, even if I don&rsquo;t recognise it in the Chicago pit.
      You see, my business is looking after freight, and the chief freight of
      our road is wheat. Therefore, wherever wheat grows I must visit that spot,
      and I have done so. I give you my oath that wheat is bound to be a dollar
      a bushel before two months are past. It&rsquo;s under seventy-five cents now,
      and it doesn&rsquo;t take much figuring to show the possibilities of the
      situation. Three things are wanted: knowledge, courage, money. I have
      given you the knowledge; do you possess the other two requisites?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, I esteem you very much&mdash;more so now than when you came in; but,
      after all&rsquo;s said and done, I&rsquo;d be simply banking on one man&rsquo;s word.
      Suppose I go in half a million dollars? You say that knowledge is the
      first requisite. Have I got that knowledge? I have not. I have merely your
      word that you have the knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s a good point to make,&rdquo; said Tom imperturbably. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      know me well enough to risk it. That&rsquo;s all right. Now, I see on your wall
      the big map of our road, which I suppose you have kept as a relic of your
      connection with the Wheat Belt Line. It&rsquo;s a lovely map, with the Wheat
      Belt Line in heavy black as the great thing, and the United States sort of
      hung around it as a background. There,&rdquo; continued Tom, waving his hand
      towards the huge map on the wall, &ldquo;coloured yellow by Rand, McNally and
      Co., are the wheat-producing districts of the United States and Canada.
      Now, I&rsquo;ve been all over that yellow ground. I assert that in no part of it
      is the wheat crop normal. You pick out at random five or six spots in that
      yellow ground, and I&rsquo;ll tell you just what percentage of failure there&rsquo;ll
      be in those places you select. Then get on the train and visit them,
      question the farmers, and find out if they corroborate my statement. If
      they do, the chances are strong I am right about every other district.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele got up and began pacing the floor, his hands thrust in his
      trousers pockets, his forehead wrinkled with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, that&rsquo;s pretty straight talk,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been
      following the wheat-market&mdash;it&rsquo;s out of my line; but I dimly remember
      seeing in the papers not very long ago an estimate that we were going to
      have the most profitable wheat crop of recent years. Of course, that may
      be newspaper talk; but if recollection serves, it was backed up by
      telegrams from all over the West. How do you account for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t account for it. I am merely stating what I know. If the papers
      made such an estimate they were wrong, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele stopped in his walk and touched an electric button on his desk. A
      young man appeared in response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holmes,&rdquo; said Steele, &ldquo;there was an account of the wheat crop all over
      the country in the papers the other day&mdash;occupied a page, I think. Go
      to the nearest newspaper office and get a copy. As you go out, tell
      Bronson to come in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Bronson appeared, Steele said sharply: &ldquo;Find out for me, from some
      reliable source, the lowest price of wheat for the last ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an amazingly short space of time Holmes reappeared with a newspaper a
      week old, and laid it on Mr. Steele&rsquo;s desk, and Bronson brought in an
      array of figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; cried Steele, jerking open the crackling sheet. &ldquo;&lsquo;Wonderful
      harvests ahead! Tremendous wheat crops!&rsquo; Of course, it must be remembered
      that prophesying prosperity is always popular, and newspapers like that
      sort of news. Now, I shall select twenty-five places named in this paper.
      The useful Bronson will find out for me a reliable man in each place, and
      I will telegraph him. By to-morrow we should have replies from some
      fifteen or twenty of them; and if the majority say that the wheat crop is
      a failure, then I think we may rely on your forecast. Now, let us see what
      Bronson&rsquo;s figures are. Sixty-five, sixty-two and a half, sixty-four and an
      eighth, fifty-three and five-eighths, forty-eight and three-quarters&mdash;gee-whillikins,
      that&rsquo;s getting down to bedrock!&mdash;fifty, fifty-four and nine-eighths,
      sixty-nine and one-eighth, eighty-five&mdash;ah! that&rsquo;s something like&mdash;seventy-four
      and a quarter, and so on. Why, it seems from this that no man is safe in
      buying for a rise if he pays more than fifty cents a bushel, while you
      have bought at seventy-eight! Septimus Severus! I admire your nerve, but
      not your judgment. Well, drop in to-morrow, about two, and we&rsquo;ll see what
      the telegrams bring us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose, meanwhile, wheat falls another cent or two, what am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they can&rsquo;t hurt you to-day&mdash;it&rsquo;s after four o&rsquo;clock; and
      to-morrow we&rsquo;ll see what is best to be done. It is useless to conceal from
      you the fact that there is an unholy gulf between seventy-eight at which
      you bought, and fifty, to which wheat has on more than one occasion
      fallen. That means a little deficit of two hundred and eighty thousand
      dollars on your gentle flutter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth must come out soon, Mr. Steele, and it may be published any
      morning. When that happens, wheat will go up like a balloon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Tom, I can say nothing further just now. To-morrow you will
      find me brimful of information, and quite decided as to the course I shall
      take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this the visitor had to be content. Next day he arrived at Steele&rsquo;s
      office in a more cheerful frame of mind. Wheat had closed the day before
      one-eighth stronger than it was in the morning. The conference this time
      was short, sharp, and decisive. Steele was thoroughly the man of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I received seventeen replies,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and they all corroborate your
      forecast. Now, what do you wish me to do with the little parcel of wheat
      standing against your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that in return for the tip you might relieve me of
      three-quarters of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll relieve you of it all. I&rsquo;ve given orders to my brokers to buy a
      pretty large slice of the wheat crop. This purchase may perhaps send up
      the price to the seventy-eight at which you purchased. If it does, I&rsquo;ll
      sell out your lot and send you the money, which I advise you to invest in
      gilt-edged securities and leave wheat alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I know when I&rsquo;ve had enough. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s a
      sure thing, and I hate to let go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a sure thing,&rdquo; said Steele, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hand over to you a percentage
      of what I win, in return for the information you have given me. You go
      straight home, taking this newspaper with you. Write out a report similar
      in length to these Press Alliance telegrams, giving name of locality and
      the actual state of the crop in each district. Let nobody know what you
      are doing, and work all night, if necessary, until the report is complete.
      Then bring it to me, and I&rsquo;ll have it typewritten in this office. Now,
      this is my busy day. Clear out. Goodbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele&rsquo;s buying took the market by surprise. No one knew, of course, who
      the purchaser was, but the price rose rapidly, point by point, until
      seventy-eight was again reached, and then Steele instantly gave orders for
      the sale of the million bushels that stood in Tom&rsquo;s name, for the double
      purpose of getting the man his money, and lowering the price so that his
      own purchases might be accomplished at a less figure than seventy-eight.
      The sale took place an hour before the closing of business, and chanced to
      be just in the nick of time. Orders to sell came in from somewhere&mdash;supposedly
      from New York, and wheat was offered in any quantity at practically any
      price the buyers liked to pay. Someone was hammering down the market. A
      fight was on between two unknowns, and pandemonium was let loose in
      Chicago. The pit went wild, and prices came down with a run. Steele had
      already stopped his buyers, and he stood from under. Closing prices for
      wheat were sixty-five, three-eighths. John Steele did some deep thinking
      and close figuring that night. In spite of his purchases of the day, he
      had still a million dollars left to gamble with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend the bear,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;is very likely to keep up his
      antics to-morrow, to frighten the opposition. If he squeezes down prices
      to sixty, I&rsquo;ll buy five million bushels. Every cent of a drop will mean a
      loss of fifty thousand dollars. It reached fifty in &lsquo;94, and next year a
      cent and a quarter less, but this price has never on any other occasion
      been touched in the last forty years. Even if it drops to that, I&rsquo;ll have
      lost half a million or so, but I can still hang on. I&rsquo;m not trying to
      corner the market; so, Mr. Bruin, go ahead, and let us see what happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day the panic and the slump continued. Wheat fell to fifty-nine, and
      between that price and sixty-one John Steele secured his five million
      bushels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who were the operators? That was what the papers wanted to know. Was it,
      as surmised, a contest between New York and Chicago? All the well-known
      dealers were interviewed, but each and every one insisted he was merely an
      interested spectator, holding an umbrella over his head. There was going
      to be a blizzard, so everybody had his eye on the cyclone cellar. Experts
      said it was a good time to seek cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, John Steele might have rested on his oars. He was reasonably
      safe&mdash;in fact, he was perfectly safe if he merely held on, which was
      a good position to be in. But he had a plan of his own, although he
      resolved not to buy further unless wheat reached the low limit of half a
      dollar. In that case he feared he would plunge. This night, however, he
      proceeded to carry out his plan, which led to amazing results. He put
      Tom&rsquo;s report of the wheat crop&rsquo;s condition, now nicely typewritten, into
      his inside pocket, and locked up his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the upper windows of a commodious business block were aglow with
      electric light. It was the home of the Press Alliance, with telegraphic
      nerves reaching to the furthermost parts of the earth. Its business was to
      gather news, which it furnished to journals belonging to the Alliance.
      John Steele was acquainted with Simmonds, the manager, and resolved to pay
      him an evening call at what was certainly a most inopportune moment. The
      great hive was a-hum with activity. The wild day on the Stock Exchange was
      enough of itself to keep it throbbing. Simmonds was a busy man, but he
      received John Steele, who came in cool and self-possessed, with courtesy
      and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Simmonds, I suppose you&rsquo;re just rushed to death, so I&rsquo;ll not detain
      you a moment. I want to see one of your men who is less busy, if, indeed,
      he is here to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all here to-night, Steele. I hope you&rsquo;ve not been dabbling in
      wheat?&rdquo;
     </p>

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s going to get badly hurt before the week is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I understand,&rdquo; said Steele nonchalantly, as if it were none of his
      affair. &ldquo;By the way, talking of wheat, you gather statistics of the crops
      from all over the country, don&rsquo;t you&mdash;your company, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, several times a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what office is that done, New York or Chicago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chicago, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is in charge of that department?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicholson. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to have a chat with him if he&rsquo;s not too busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve mentioned the one man who isn&rsquo;t busy to-night. You see, his
      work is a daylight job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a fellow is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a new man&mdash;at least, he&rsquo;s been with us only six months&mdash;that
      is, at this office. He came on from New York. Splendid fellow, though, and
      well up to his work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. May I see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out if he&rsquo;s in his room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simmonds spoke through a telephone, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Nicholson will see you; but I say, Steele, don&rsquo;t meddle with
      wheat. If you want any information from him, remember he can&rsquo;t give it
      out, except to the morning papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shan&rsquo;t buy a bushel of wheat; don&rsquo;t be frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This boy will take you to Mr. Nicholson&rsquo;s room. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicholson proved to be a man of uncertain age. His hair was closely
      cropped, his face smoothly shaven, bearing a look of determination and
      power, which one might not have expected to find in a mere subordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Mr. John Steele,&rdquo; he asked pleasantly, &ldquo;the Napoleon of finance
      who stood out against Rockervelt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know about the Napoleon part of it, Mr. Nicholson, but
      Rockervelt and I had a little negotiation a while ago which I trust ended
      in our mutual advantage. Now, Mr. Nicholson,&rdquo; continued Steele, sitting
      down in the chair offered him, &ldquo;if you are not too busy I should like to
      ask you a few questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not very busy, Mr. Steele, and shall be pleased to answer any
      question you ask, so long as the information sought belongs to me, and not
      to my employers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is your employer, Mr. Nicholson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My employer? Why, the Press Alliance, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Press Alliance is one of your employers, I know. Your nominal
      employer, let us say. It pays you to collect accurate information. Who
      pays you for disseminating false news in the daily journals of this
      country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If John Steele expected a start of guilty surprise or a flash of anger or
      a demand for explanation, he was disappointed. The impassive face remained
      impassive. The piercing eyes narrowed a little, perhaps, but he could have
      sworn that the faint glimmer of a smile hovered about the firm lips. The
      voice that spoke was under perfect control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that all things come to him who waits, and here is an
      illustration of it. The man for whom every reporter in Chicago is
      searching, and whom I am most desirous to meet, walks right into my
      office. How many million bushels of wheat did you buy to-day, Mr. Steele?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele was a much more genial person than this man from New York. He
      threw back his head and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Nicholson, I am delighted to have made your acquaintance. Your wild
      guess that I am the buyer of wheat is really flattering to me. Yet your
      own reference to my little contest with Rockervelt should have reminded
      you that I deal in railways, and not in grain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason I wished to meet you,&rdquo; went on Mr. Nicholson, as if the other
      had not spoken, &ldquo;is because I have a message to you from my chiefs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you have not mentioned who your chiefs are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need to mention them, Mr. Steele. When I tell you they own
      banks in every city in the United States; that the income of the head of
      our combination is fifty million dollars a year from merely one branch of
      his activity; that we have employees in the United States Treasury
      powerful enough to cause the funds of this country to be placed for safety
      in our banks; that my principals can, if they wish, gamble with the
      savings of the people of the United States deposited in their keeping;
      that they have agents in every part of the world, and that there is not a
      country in Europe, Asia, or Africa which does not pay tribute to them;
      when I have said all this, Mr. Steele, I think two things may be taken for
      granted&mdash;first: no names need be mentioned; second: you are opposed
      to a power infinitely greater than that of Mr. Rockervelt or any other
      financial force which the world contains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right in both surmises, Mr. Nicholson, and I experience that keen
      joy which warriors feel with foemen worthy of their steel&mdash;if you
      will excuse the apparent pun on my own name. I am really quoting from
      Scott, not the railway man of that name, but the poet. And now for your
      message, Mr. Nicholson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit, then, that you are the buyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit anything in the face of such a formidable rival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. My chiefs are the most generous of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we all know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have lost money these last two days, they will refund it. They are
      even willing to allow you a reasonable profit, and I am empowered to
      negotiate regarding the figures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all this for pure philanthropy, Mr. Nicholson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this if you will merely stand aside and not interfere in a market you
      do not understand, and complicate a situation that is already somewhat
      delicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I refuse to stand aside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you refuse, they will crush you, as they have crushed many a cleverer
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s not tactful, Nicholson, and I&rsquo;m sure it would not meet the
      approval of your employers. Your last remark is apt to provoke opposition
      rather than compliance. Would it surprise you to know that I possess a
      more potent backer than even your distinguished chief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More potent? Yes, it would surprise me. Have you any reluctance in
      mentioning the name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the slightest&mdash;it&rsquo;s a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Dame Nature&mdash;a charming old woman if you stand in with her; a
      blue terror if you go against her. The wheat crop in America this year
      will be only three-quarters of the normal yield, if it is that much. You
      can juggle with the fact for a little time, but you can&rsquo;t conceal it. Even
      the great firm on Broadway cannot make a blade of wheat grow where one has
      been killed by the frost&mdash;not in the same year, at least. So you may
      telegraph to your distinguished principals and tell them that John Steele
      and Dame Nature are going to dance a minuet with those two Corsican
      brothers of New York, and your fraternal friends will find some difficulty
      in keeping pace with the music. And so good-bye, Mr. Nicholson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Steele. I am very sorry we cannot come to terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once outside, Steele hailed a cab and drove to the Chicago Daily Blade
      building. Here, as at the Press Alliance, everyone was hard at work; but
      Steele&rsquo;s name was good for entrance almost anywhere in Chicago, and the
      managing editor did not keep him waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Stoliker,&rdquo; began Steele. &ldquo;I have got in my pocket the
      greatest newspaper &lsquo;beat&rsquo; that has ever been let loose on Chicago since
      the night of the Brooklyn Theatre Fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Steele, you&rsquo;re as welcome as flowers that bloom in the spring. Out
      with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a gigantic conspiracy to delude the Press and people of the
      United States.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re always trying that,&rdquo; said Stoliker indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but this time they&rsquo;ve succeeded, up to this evening. Just cast your
      eye over this document.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A managing editor is quick to form an accurate estimate of the proportions
      of a piece of news submitted to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anyone else had brought this in,&rdquo; said Stoliker slowly, &ldquo;do you know
      what I should have thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you would think it an attempt of the bulls to get in out of the
      rain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. You&rsquo;ve hit it the first time. Can you vouch for the accuracy of
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be offended, Steele, if I ask you one more question, only one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what the question is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to ask if I have been buying wheat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you seem to know exactly what&rsquo;s in my mind. Conversation is rather
      superfluous with so sharp a man as you are. <i>Have</i> you been buying
      wheat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m the person who caused the flutter in the market these last two
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I publish this, the price of wheat will instantly jump up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the evident object of the whole thing. If I prove that the
      wheat crop of America is from twenty-five to thirty per cent, short, up
      goes the price of wheat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Stoliker, your paper will sell like hot cakes, but no one will
      believe a word you say. Everyone on &rsquo;Change will think exactly as
      you do&mdash;that this is a device of the bulls, and so the price of wheat
      is likely to remain stationary for some hours. But this sensational and
      categorical statement is bound to make everybody uneasy, and there will be
      a good deal of telegraphing going on during the forenoon. By the time the
      evening papers are out, it will begin to dawn on commercial Chicago that
      you&rsquo;ve done the biggest thing that&rsquo;s been done for years. After that,
      every moment will enhance your reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, <i>if</i>&mdash;and that &lsquo;if&rsquo; is the biggest word in the
      dictionary just now&mdash;if this article is accurate. If it isn&rsquo;t, then
      the reverse of all you have predicted will happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Stoliker, I was quite prepared for this unbelief, I therefore
      took the precaution before the bank closed to get a certified cheque for a
      hundred thousand dollars, and here it is. Pay this into your bank
      tomorrow, and offer in your paper a hundred thousand dollars to anyone who
      will prove the report inaccurate. It has been compiled by a man I can
      vouch for, in the employ of the Wheat Belt Line, who has visited every
      spot mentioned in the report. Now, time is precious; I give you five
      minutes in which to make up your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need them; my mind is made up. I&rsquo;ll print it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day, events proved that Steele was no false prophet. Wheat fluctuated
      for a time up and down, then began to rise steadily, and at last shot up
      like a rocket, ending at eighty-three and a quarter. Before the week was
      out it was well over the dollar mark, and John Steele was richer by more
      than three millions of dollars. The night of the day in which he sold out
      he strolled into the Press Alliance offices and visited his perturbed
      friend Simmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to see Mr. Nicholson again,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, curse him!&rdquo; cried Simmonds, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone to New York; and I wish he had
      never left there. I suppose you don&rsquo;t know what a hole he put us into,
      because you&rsquo;re not interested in wheat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Why, I was tremendously impressed by Nicholson&rsquo;s manner and
      appearance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, his manner and appearance were all right. He came here with the very
      highest recommendations&mdash;in fact, he was the one man in our employ of
      all the hundreds here that I had orders from headquarters not to dismiss
      on any account. I was as much taken with his looks as you were. I would
      have sworn he was true to his employers, yet I have not the slightest
      doubt he sold them as if they were a flock of sheep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, Simmonds. He was perfectly true to his employers.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE EMBODIMENT OF MAMMON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE now projects
      across these pages the sinister shadow of a man. He was one seldom seen
      except by his immediate business associates, and yet seldom has a
      newspaper been issued that did not contain his name. This was Peter
      Berrington, the greatest financial brain the world had hitherto produced&mdash;the
      modern embodiment of Mammon. In early life there had occurred to him the
      obvious proposition that if any one man could control the manufacture and
      sale of some simple article in universal use, he would secure a fortune
      greater than that of all the monarchs on earth put together. Peter
      Berrington chose soap as his medium, and the world-renowned trust called
      Amalgamated Soap has been the outcome. His methods were as simple as his
      products. He offered what he considered a fair price to a rival for his
      business and if that rival refused, Peter crushed him by a competition the
      other could not withstand. Berrington seemed to act on one fixed rule in
      life, which was to avoid the law courts wherever possible; yet,
      nevertheless, he was haled to the bar on many occasions, but invariably he
      escaped unscathed, without a stain on his character, as if the soap he
      supplied to the universe had removed even the suspicion of dishonesty from
      himself. It pleases the world to buy soap under different titles, but it
      is all manufactured by the same company. Berrington&rsquo;s air-tight monopoly
      finally produced an annual income in excess of the fortune any man on
      earth possessed twenty-five years ago. With this ever-increasing income he
      bought banks, first in New York, then in every other great city, and
      finally in the larger towns. He purchased trust companies and insurance
      associations. He bought railways and steamship lines, also city councils
      and State legislators, judges, juries and senators. He was now the
      guardian and manipulator of the people&rsquo;s savings, and his banks had the
      handling of all the money the United States Government possessed.
      Magazines printed vivid articles exhibiting the dark points of his career.
      Peter never entered a protest. Powerful newspapers hurled vigorous
      denunciations against him, but Peter never replied. The few who knew him
      in private life described him as a quiet, timorous man, apparently without
      opinions of his own, who was withal deeply religious. Yet all the
      histories printed of him never contained the record of any man who had
      defeated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but natural, then, that the Chicago papers should make much of John
      Steele&rsquo;s encounter with this giant of the financial world. Steele had met
      him on the battle-ground of the Chicago wheat-pit, and had routed him,
      horse, foot and dragoons. <i>The Daily Blade&rsquo;s</i> exposure of the real
      wheat situation of the country had been so sudden that the barrels of
      money which Peter Berrington kept in readiness to buy the whole crop, when
      he had hammered the price low enough, remained unopened and unexpended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berrington would have made billions at one fell swoop had not this man
      Steele blindly, quite unwittingly, stumbled across his path and tripped
      him up. The newspapers exaggeratingly credited Steele with making many
      more millions than he had actually secured, and it was only when the
      anxious three days of panic had ended that Steele himself realised what a
      tremendous fortune had been within his grasp if he could have commanded
      the capital to manipulate the situation, or even if he had risked all he
      actually possessed. Indeed, Steele perceived when too late that he had
      blundered into the biggest deal ever projected upon this earth, and while
      he undoubtedly spoiled the game for its inaugurates, he did not himself
      profit nearly as much as might have been the case. He began to question
      his own judgment, and the uneasy thought came to him that if he had made
      terms that night with Nicholson in the office of the Press Alliance, he
      might have made from ten to twenty millions instead of three or four. Yet
      he was consoled by the belief that Peter would have been true to no
      bargain he might have made, and in the end would have robbed him of the
      agreed share. In spite of his religious reputation, Peter was accredited
      with no qualms of conscience in a business transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Western newspapers re-recited Steele&rsquo;s brief besting of Rockervelt,
      which was now utterly eclipsed by his victory over Berrington, and they
      jocularly advised New York rustics to stay at home and not venture into a
      real city like Chicago. In face of all this ridicule, and in spite of
      accusations and denunciations levelled against him for his efforts to
      mislead a free and incorruptible Press, Peter Berrington made no sign, and
      New York silently swallowed up the mysterious Nicholson. A few wiseacres
      in Chicago shook their heads as they read the laudations of Mr. John
      Steele, saying the young man was not yet done with Peter Berrington; and
      later events proved the correctness of their surmise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steele himself was not particularly frightened at the outlook, but neither
      was he extremely pleased. He was sorry that Fate had brought him into
      opposition with Peter Berrington, but he had learned that fact too late to
      withdraw. When he met Nicholson, and became aware that the Great Bear was
      Amalgamated Soap, he was already committed too deeply for half measures to
      aid him. He had acted at once, decisively and successfully, and would have
      been relieved had he merely got out even. It was his usual luck that he
      came away with large profits, and for that he thanked Fate, because he
      knew his enemy was ruthless. Success did not turn his head in the least.
      He was a cool thinker and detested all this newspaper notoriety. He knew
      fortunes were not made by the beating of drums, and he kept very quiet
      until the hubbub was over, refusing to see reporters or say anything about
      the matter, save to his most intimate friends. He hoped that some fresh
      sensation would speedily drive his name from the columns of the Press, and
      until that time came he sought shelter, doing nothing. He comforted
      himself with the thought that Peter Berrington, while merciless to an
      opponent, was merciless merely to acquire that opponent&rsquo;s business. He
      believed the great man to be entirely without sentiment, and therefore
      surmised he would not seek revenge when an act was once completed and done
      with. Nevertheless, he resolved to keep his weather eye open, which was
      wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new celebrity he had attained brought all sorts and conditions of men
      to his offices. He began to think that every wild-cat scheme in the
      country was placed before him. Letters poured in from various parts of the
      world, and he was offered gold mines, patents, railways, steamship lines,
      industrial enterprises and what not. He took larger offices and protected
      himself from intrusion. He became a much more difficult man to see than
      even the President of the United States&mdash;or perhaps it would be more
      fitting to say than Mr. Peter Berrington, for Peter allowed no outsider to
      penetrate to his den.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one man, however, who succeeded in reaching the inner room of
      John Steele, and his card bore the name of William Metcalfe. This card had
      been preceded, however, by some excellent letters of introduction, and so
      John Steele made an appointment with him. He was favourably impressed by
      the appearance of Mr. Metcalfe, who did not look like a city man, but
      rather a cross between a bluff farmer and a shrewd manufacturer&mdash;which,
      indeed, he turned out to be. After seating himself, William Metcalfe
      plunged directly into the heart of his business, without preliminary,
      which also pleased John Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your time is valuable,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;so is mine. I have undertaken an
      operation that proves too big for me, and I want you to help me carry it
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have three rules, Mr. Metcalfe, which I rarely break. In the first
      place, I never finance anything. If, for instance, you wish to build a
      factory, or to exploit a patent, it is useless coming to me expecting
      help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no factory to build and no patent to exploit,&rdquo; said Metcalfe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My second rule is that the man with whom I go in, must be prepared to put
      up dollar for dollar with me in hard cash, and not in future prospects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am prepared to do that,&rdquo; rejoined Metcalfe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My third rule is that I must see for myself and understand the business
      offered. I do not give a hang for the opinions of experts. If the proposal
      is complicated beyond my comprehension, I don&rsquo;t go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; commended Metcalfe. &ldquo;None of your three rules will be in
      the least infringed by me. Do you know anything of the beet-sugar
      business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of Bradley, of Bay City?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what Bradley accomplished may be understood by a ten-year-old boy.
      He went over to Germany, and came back with a parcel of seeds in his
      handbag, which seeds he planted. From that parcel has grown the beet root
      industry of Michigan. There are now factories in that State capitalised at
      ten millions of dollars. There are nearly a hundred thousand acres of
      Michigan land in beets. Ten years ago I hadn&rsquo;t a penny; to-day I think I
      could put as much money on the table as you, and all on account of those
      seeds Bradley brought from Germany. I own three big factories in Michigan,
      and four others in States further west. You hinted that you didn&rsquo;t wish to
      deal in probabilities; but, if you will forgive me for saying it, there is
      no industry in this country at the present moment which offers greater
      promise than the manufacture of sugar out of beetroot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; remarked Steele indifferently. &ldquo;I am quite willing to
      applaud the excellent Bradley, who made millions of beets grow where none
      had grown before. I admire such a man exceedingly, even though unprepared
      to follow in his steps. You see, Mr. Metcalfe, I am not a useful citizen
      like yourself and Mr. Bradley. I simply make a raid at some project, filch
      what I can, and get back into my den. As I told you, I am not building
      factories, not even those that squeeze the succulent beet. I squeeze my
      opponents on the Stock Exchange. My motto is large profits and quick
      returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here to offer you immense profits and immediate returns. I
      understand the sugar business down to the ground, and have realised its
      possibilities for several years past. Therefore I determined to combine
      all the big sugar factories at present existing in the United States.
      Rapidly as I myself have acquired wealth, the sugar business has been
      growing too quickly for me, and at the beginning of this year I saw I had
      to put my project into action, or else interest a body of financiers,
      which I did not wish to do, for my ambition is to control the sugar-beet
      industry of the United States, and ultimately of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you hope to become a sort of sweetened Peter Berrington,&rdquo; said
      Steele, with a smile, and he thought of this remark somewhat grimly later
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Metcalfe seriously, without duplicating the other&rsquo;s smile.
      &ldquo;As I told you, I own outright seven factories. I secured options on all
      the rest, and in each case have paid down a forfeit, for I shall be
      compelled to buy outright within the next month if I am to hold them. Now,
      the total cost of all the factories in the States at present, built or
      building, comes to almost double the capital I possess. If you will put up
      dollar for dollar with me, we will purchase these factories outright. Then
      we will form the whole into a gigantic company. When this is done, you can
      withdraw your money, and probably as much more as you put in. If the
      public does not subscribe the full amount we demand, I will guarantee to
      relieve you at par of all the shares that may fall to your portion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you guarantee to do that when at the present moment you have not
      got more than half the necessary capital for forming the company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can guarantee it because I am certain the public will subscribe; but
      even if they do not, the moment the company is formed there is a bank in
      this city willing to advance me cash to the amount of three-quarters of
      our capital. Therefore I can guarantee that you will double your money
      within a month&mdash;that is, within a month of your putting it in. You
      say you care nothing for the opinions of experts; neither do I, therefore
      I propose that you become my guest for two weeks, and visit most of the
      factories now under my control. You can see the books and balance-sheets
      of my own concerns, and from what you learn under my tuition you will be
      able to form a very good estimate of how the other factories are placed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand very little about company promoting,&rdquo; said Steele dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood just as little a short time since, but it was necessary that
      I should learn, and I have learnt. Besides, I have secured letters of
      introduction to Far-well Brothers, the most substantial and honest firm
      connected with that business in Chicago. The same people introduced me to
      them that introduced me to you. Suppose, for instance, the combined
      factories were to cost us ten million dollars. With such prospects as
      there are ahead, we would be quite justified in forming a company for
      twenty millions. If the public subscribed only half of what we demanded,
      we would have our factories for nothing, and still control the
      combination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about your working capital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need working capital. Every factory is making money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, candidly, Mr. Metcalfe, that project seems too easy and simple to
      be entirely feasible. There must be something lying in wait to wreck it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so far as I can see,&rdquo; said Metcalfe confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if the public do not subscribe a penny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve looked out for that. When I got the options, there was, of
      course, no longer any need for keeping the affair secret, and I have
      already been promised subscriptions to the new company to the extent of
      one-third the proposed capital of twenty millions. That one-third will be
      subscribed in Michigan and Wisconsin alone, without touching the State of
      Illinois or the capitalists of Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Metcalfe, you appear to have thought of everything. I&rsquo;ll
      accept your invitation, so long as it binds me to nothing, and will go
      wherever you lead me, beginning, let us say, with one of your own
      factories. I understand figures, and I shall want to see the books and
      make a somewhat thorough search into the income of at least the principal
      factories. You have no objection to that, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not in the least. Big as our capitalisation will be, this is a
      thoroughly sound industrial proposition, and before five years are over I
      am certain that we will be justified in doubling our normal capital if we
      wish to do so, and paying a mighty good percentage on the same. Of course,
      I stand by the business. I suppose you wish to pull out as quickly as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the idea. I hope you have not offered extravagant prices for
      these factories?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the point. I have not. You see, as I told you, I am
      thoroughly acquainted with the business. A capitalist from New York or
      Chicago might have been deluded, but they cannot delude a practical man
      like myself. Indeed, to convince you of the confidence that others show in
      the proposed company, I may tell you that the capital promised comes
      largely from the present owners of those factories, who appreciate the
      economies to be inaugurated by combination, and who in some instances are
      putting back into the new company the entire amount I shall pay them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they know you intend to capitalise for double what the property has
      cost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally not, Mr. Steele. Of course they understand I am not in this
      business entirely for my health; but apart from that, anyone conversant
      with the progress the beet industry has made during the last four or five
      years is well aware that the developments of the next five or six will be
      something enormous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr Metcalfe I&rsquo;m ready to go with you to-morrow, if that is not
      too soon for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele&rsquo;s visits to the beet-sugar district more than corroborated all
      that Mr. Metcalfe had told him. Quietly he studied his host and guide
      during the excursion, and the more he saw of him the better he liked him.
      If there was an honest man in the country, that man appeared to be William
      Metcalfe, in spite of his determination to capitalise the properties for
      double what he paid for them. John&rsquo;s own conscience was not supersensitive
      on this point, and his private opinion would have been that a man was a
      fool not to take all he could get. So, before they returned to Chicago, he
      had quite made up his mind to become a partner with William Metcalfe in
      forming the Consolidated Beet Sugar Company, Metcalfe having no domicile
      in Chicago, the headquarters of the new trust was the private office of
      John Steele and the apartments adjoining. These adjoining apartments were
      occupied by William Metcalfe, upon whose shoulders naturally fell the bulk
      of the work. It was he who saw the lawyers to whom he had been introduced;
      who negotiated with the bank and made such outside arrangements as were
      necessary in the launching of so gigantic a scheme. Steele was more and
      more impressed with the business capacity of his new partner as the days
      went on, and he congratulated himself on being in conjunction with so
      capable a man. Notwithstanding his increasing confidence he never for a
      moment relaxed his vigilance, nor was anything done without his sanction
      and approval, and he allowed no obscure point to pass without thoroughly
      mastering it. Towards the conclusion of preliminary arrangements, he saw
      with some apprehension that this project would involve every penny of
      capital he possessed, and this, of course, was cause for anxiety, though
      not for alarm, because all the omens were favourable. Yet his vigilance
      might have been of little avail had not chance played into his hands.
      Steele was constantly in the office; Metcalfe was frequently called
      elsewhere, and in one of his absences a telegraph-boy brought in a
      message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any answer?&rdquo; asked the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steele tore open the envelope and gazed at the telegram for a moment,
      uncomprehending. It was in cipher. Then he looked at the envelope and saw
      it was addressed to his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No answer,&rdquo; said Steele to the boy; &ldquo;but look here, my lad, do you want
      to earn fifty cents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied the messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, get me another envelope from the nearest telegraph-office. I
      see this is for my partner, not for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw half-a-dollar on the table, which the boy grasped eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be as quick as you can,&rdquo; cried Steele, before he reached the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cipher telegram was a long one, but speedily Steele wrote it out on a
      sheet of paper. When the boy returned with the envelope, Steele placed the
      telegram within it, sealed it, and addressed it in imitation of the
      telegraphic clerk. Then he walked into the adjoining office and placed the
      resealed telegram on Mr. Metcalfe&rsquo;s desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, why does honest William Metcalfe receive a long telegram in cipher
      from New York?&rdquo; said Steele to himself, knitting his brows. &ldquo;He has never
      even mentioned New York to me, yet he is in secret communication with
      someone there. Lord! one can never tell when the biggest sort of crank
      will not suddenly loom up as the most useful man in the world!&rdquo; cried
      Steele, as he suddenly bethought himself of Billy Brooks, a jocular person
      who bored all Chicago with his knowledge of cipher, claiming there was
      nothing he couldn&rsquo;t unravel except the Knock Alphabet cipher of the
      Russian Nihilists. And Billy had his office in the fifteenth storey of the
      adjoining block. Steele shoved the copy of the telegram in his trousers&rsquo;
      pocket, put on his silk hat, went down one elevator, and up another, in
      almost less time than it takes to tell about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Billy, I&rsquo;ve got a cipher here that you can&rsquo;t decode, and I&rsquo;ve got
      twenty dollars to bet on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see your cipher,&rdquo; cried Billy, his eyes sparkling. &ldquo;All ciphers
      fall into seven distinct classes. These classes are then sub-divided into&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, I know!&rdquo; cried Steele impatiently. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy glanced at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand over your twenty dollars, Steele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you haven&rsquo;t solved it already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I see at a glance it falls into division three and into
      sub-division nineteen. I&rsquo;ll decode it within an hour. Shall I bring it
      over to your office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Billy, I&rsquo;ll sit down right here, even if you are six hours at it. I
      herewith place two ten-dollar bills on your desk, and if this proves
      important, which it may or may not, I&rsquo;ll multiply those bills by ten; and
      for that number of days, at least, I shall require the utmost secrecy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, John, sit down and keep quiet, and there&rsquo;s the latest evening
      paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in the room as Billy opened a bookcase and took down one
      bulky tome, two medium-sized books, and a number of smaller volumes that
      looked like dictionaries. Turning to his desk, he wrote the message in a
      variety of different ways, on as many sheets of paper. For nearly
      three-quarters of an hour no sound was heard but the scratching of a pen
      now and then, and the rustle of leaves. Then the stillness was broken by a
      war-whoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, John, my boy; and I&rsquo;ll take my Bible oath on its accuracy.
      Couldn&rsquo;t be such a series of coincidences as to run so smoothly
      otherwise.=
    </p>
    <p>
      ````"Precious greenbacks! Loot divine!
    </p>
    <p>
      ````Twenty dollars, you are mine!&rdquo;=
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy jubilantly grasped the currency and shoved it into his pocket,
      handing the sheet of paper to Steele, who read: &ldquo;I shall occupy room one
      hundred and fifty at the Grand Pacific Hotel on Thursday, the
      twenty-seventh, at eleven a. m. Do not ask for me at the office, nor take
      the elevator, but come up the stair, and rap twice. Wait two minutes, and
      rap a third time. Bring all documents with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; said Steele rather seriously, &ldquo;we will now burn all your
      figuring, if you don&rsquo;t mind, and then I wish you to obliterate this from
      your memory. I cannot tell until after Thursday whether it is important or
      not. I think, however, if you keep mum, this will be worth an extra two
      hundred dollars to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can depend on me, John. We&rsquo;re not all making money as fast as you
      are. Of course, I know that financial ciphers are usually important.
      Here&rsquo;s the <i>débris</i>; burn it on the oilcloth, near the register.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele&rsquo;s investigation of the Grand Pacific Hotel floor occupied by room
      one hundred and fifty showed him that this apartment was well chosen, for
      neither of the rooms on either side had a communicating door. However, he
      engaged room one hundred and forty-nine, on the opposite side of the hall,
      and before ten o&rsquo;clock on the twenty-seventh he took up his position
      inside that apartment. When eleven o&rsquo;clock approached, he locked his door,
      shoved the table against it, stood thereon, and looked through the transom
      into the hall. He darkened his own window so that he could not be observed
      by anyone glancing up outside. He heard the first knock, then cautiously
      peered down and recognised William Metcalfe standing there, facing the
      opposite door, with a bundle under his arm. After the third knock,
      Metcalfe entered, but opened the door so slightly that Steele could see
      nothing within, nor did he hear any greeting voice. A full hour passed
      with not a sound from the closed room, then Metcalfe came out again, with
      the bundle still under his arm, and walked quietly away, leaving his
      partner on watch at the transom. Time goes slowly for a man on tip-toe
      with eyes strained, but at last his patience was rewarded. The door
      opposite opened, and the head of Nicholson appeared. He glanced quickly up
      and down the hall, and as the way was apparently clear, stepped out and
      vanished. John Steele came down from the table, drew aside the curtains,
      and let the light into the darkened room. He poured some water from the
      carafe into a tumbler, swallowed the liquid at a gulp, then sank into the
      arm-chair beside the bed. He gave utterance to an uneasy laugh, then
      muttered a sentence which might be called unexpected: &ldquo;Billy Brooks, my
      boy, you&rsquo;ll get your two hundred dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drawing a deep breath, he then concentrated his mind on the crisis with
      which he was confronted. Metcalfe was probably the owner of the sugar
      factories, and was, as he had said, a well-known business man in Michigan;
      but, nevertheless, here was undoubted proof that he was a minion of
      Amalgamated Soap, a mere pawn in the hands of Peter Berrington and his
      strong colleague, Nicholson. Every penny John Steele possessed was sunk in
      Consolidated Sugar, and that these men meant to ruin him he had not the
      slightest doubt. The question was, How could they do it? Even if
      Metcalfe&rsquo;s books had been false, even if a hundred per cent, too much had
      been paid for the factories, there would still be something left for him
      out of the wreck. Yet from the moment he saw the face of Nicholson at that
      door, he knew Amalgamated Soap had determined to strip him of every <i>sou</i>
      he possessed. The first obvious suggestion that occurred to him was that
      here was the occasion for consulting a first-class lawyer, yet what could
      a lawyer do for him? He had no money to fight. The more he thought of the
      situation, the worse it appeared. No doubt Farwell Brothers were employees
      of Amalgamated Soap. No doubt the bank in which his funds were deposited
      belonged to the same all-embracing combination. There were a hundred
      perfectly legal methods by which the amount lodged there could be tied up,
      while, if he appealed to the law, the expense would be tremendous, and he
      might be dragged from court to court; new trial could follow new trial,
      and appeal tread on the heels of appeal until his millions had vanished
      into thin air. He was as entirely in the hands of Amalgamated Soap as if
      he had been tied in a bundle and presented to that celebrated company.
      Terror was imported into the situation by his uncertainty as to what
      method these financial buccaneers would adopt. Yet at that distressful
      moment his mind wandered to the comic opera of the &ldquo;Mikado,&rdquo; and a smile
      came to his lips. Would it be long and lingering, with boiling oil at the
      end of it, or would it be the short, sharp shock of the executioner&rsquo;s
      stroke? His resentment turned more against the apparently honest Metcalfe
      than toward even Nicholson or Peter Berrington. He would have liked to
      throttle that man, but he knew that, whatever the outcome, he must retain
      his grip on himself and present an impassive exterior to his colleague and
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning John Steele met his partner as usual with a smile on his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Metcalfe, how are things going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, everything&rsquo;s coming our way,&rdquo; said Metcalfe. &ldquo;This trick will be done
      so easily that you&rsquo;ll wonder you ever doubted its success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope so, I hope so,&rdquo; replied Steele, the possible double meaning
      of his partner&rsquo;s phrase striking him like a blow in the face; but the
      smile never wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technically the company had already been formed&mdash;that is to say, a
      number of clerks in Steele&rsquo;s office, together with the brothers Farwell,
      had constituted themselves the Consolidated Sugar Beet Company, with
      various powers duly set forth, organised under the laws of the State of
      New Jersey, and when officers were selected, the beet sugar factories were
      bought by this company at just double the price Steele and Metcalfe had
      paid for them. Then the officials resigned in a body, when cheques had
      been passed and everything done with beautiful legality, while Steele and
      Metcalfe and their nominees took their places on the board. It was
      arranged that there should be seven directors. Steele was to nominate two,
      and Metcalfe was to nominate two, while they were to agree mutually on the
      chairman. Metcalfe had proposed that the elder Farwell should be chairman,
      and he nominated the younger as his colleague on the board. Farwell, who
      knew every intricacy of company law, was accepted by Steele, and there was
      still one nomination open to Metcalfe, which name he excused himself at
      this time from proposing, as he was not well enough acquainted with
      business men in Chicago to fill the place at the moment. He even intimated
      that he was willing to accept a nominee of Steele&rsquo;s, and this seemingly
      friendly suggestion had prevented any suspicion of the board being packed
      against him, arising in Jack Steele&rsquo;s mind. He remembered this now with
      bitterness, when it was too late for remedy. Steele and his two colleagues
      could tie the vote of Metcalfe and his colleagues, but the chairman would
      have the casting vote. Since he had seen the determined face of Nicholson
      in the corridor of the Grand Pacific, he had no doubt that the Farwell
      brothers were the minions of Peter Berrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the trap laid for the public was sprung, and the public, as usual,
      was nipped. The success of the flotation was immediate, although
      applications did not come within a million of the sum asked for. After the
      flotation, Metcalfe&rsquo;s manner changed perceptibly. Steele watched him as a
      cat watches a mouse, and saw that he was now perturbed and apparently
      dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; cried Steele to him, the morning after the figures were known to
      them, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t seem nearly so happy as I expected. You surely did not
      look for the shares to be subscribed twice over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Metcalfe gloomily, &ldquo;but the amount that has been subscribed
      shows what vitality there was in the scheme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vitality!&rdquo; cried Steele. &ldquo;Bless my soul! you never doubted it, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no,&rdquo; said Metcalfe hastily. &ldquo;No. I told you we were dead sure of
      a third, and the actual subscriptions have more than justified my
      forecast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have indeed!&rdquo; cried Steele enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what it is, Metcalfe, you&rsquo;re one of the first financiers of
      this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense!&rdquo; cried Metcalfe, in no way cheered by the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t nonsense,&rdquo; said the genial Steele. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken lessons from a
      first-rate master, for I look on Nicholson as one of the best men in the
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When John Steele had plumped a similar pointed remark at Nicholson, not
      the slightest change of expression had disturbed that individual&rsquo;s calm
      visage. William Metcalfe kept his countenance under less perfect
      restraint. Steele&rsquo;s smile was gentle and friendly, but his keen eyes
      missed no note of the other&rsquo;s face. He watched a ruddy flush mount into
      his partner&rsquo;s cheeks. He noticed the embarrassed hesitation that
      accompanied his utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Nicholson! Ah, yes, certainly, certainly. He&rsquo;s not a friend of mine,
      of course, only a slight and recent acquaintance. Not the sort of man,
      Nicholson, to form friendships easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; asked Steele. &ldquo;I met him only once, but he seemed rather
      genial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great business man, a great business man,&rdquo; hurriedly muttered Metcalfe,
      obviously trying to get himself under control once more, playing for time,
      and not quite knowing what he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have been informed,&rdquo; remarked Steele with easy carelessness. &ldquo;One of
      the Amalgamated Soap group, I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; rejoined Metcalfe, his own man once more. &ldquo;You see, Mr.
      Steele, I thought it would strengthen us tremendously if I could get a man
      like Nicholson to become interested in our project. The mere rumour that
      Amalgamated Soap was behind us would have been worth millions to us at the
      present juncture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you, Metcalfe. Amalgamated Soap is a name to conjure
      with. The public worship success, and there you have success in its most
      highly developed form. Why didn&rsquo;t you let me know? I might have been of
      some assistance to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in the first place, I did not wish to mention so important a matter
      until I was sure of carrying it through. No use of giving promises that
      you cannot make good. In the second place, I was not aware that you knew
      Nicholson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you were quite right; it was just a casual meeting, when we were
      introduced by a mutual friend. I don&rsquo;t flatter myself that my views would
      have any influence upon a man of Nicholson&rsquo;s standing in the financial
      world. But there is another part I don&rsquo;t quite understand. I admit the
      value of Nicholson&rsquo;s name to us, but why wasn&rsquo;t his connection divulged in
      time to influence subscriptions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, it was like this,&rdquo; hesitated Metcalfe, for a liar must be a most
      agile person, and Steele&rsquo;s questions had a fashion of touching the spot.
      &ldquo;It was like this. I did not really conclude my arrangement with Nicholson
      until this morning. He&rsquo;s a very difficult man to handle, and he knows as
      well as anyone his own value. I imagine he wished to see which way the cat
      was going to jump before he committed himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Metcalfe, the cat has jumped entirely our way, even if the leap did
      not reach the furthest mark we staked out. The success of the
      subscriptions, then, induced Nicholson to join us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, quite so, with the proviso that he is to have the vacant seat
      at the board, unless you have any objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Objection? Certainly not. I am highly delighted with our acquisition.
      Besides, the seat at the board is entirely in your gift. I have no right
      to object, even if I wished to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was said with such an air of childlike simplicity that the perturbed
      Metcalfe, who seemingly still retained some remnants of conscience, showed
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Still, I should not like to nominate anyone
      who might be personally distasteful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot imagine, Metcalfe, why you should suppose Nicholson could be
      distasteful to anyone. He is a tower of strength. I am overjoyed that you
      have induced him to join us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much relieved to hear you say so,&rdquo; rejoined Metcalfe, who
      seemed bewildered at the turn things had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preliminary meetings of the company had all been held in Steele&rsquo;s
      offices. This afternoon, however, the directors were to forgather at the
      board-room of the bank in which the deposits of the subscribers were
      lodged. Steele was thus to beard the lion in the lion&rsquo;s own den, for he
      now no longer doubted that this bank was owned by Peter Berrington,
      Nicholson and their colleagues. The appointed hour was three o&rsquo;clock, and
      John Steele arrived on the stroke, the last man to appear. Nicholson stood
      in the centre of the group. Metcalfe, who had quite recovered his
      composure, said with a fine air of good comradeship:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you two gentlemen have met before, so a formal introduction is
      not necessary between Mr. Steele and Mr. Nicholson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the somewhat chastened satisfaction of encountering Mr. Steele once
      under conditions I am not likely to forget,&rdquo; said Nicholson quietly, with
      impressive geniality. &ldquo;I count myself one of Mr. Steele&rsquo;s numerous
      admirers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is kind of you to say that, Mr. Nicholson,&rdquo; replied John, extending
      his hand, while that winning smile of his played about his lips. &ldquo;On the
      occasion to which you refer, I was so unhappy as to be placed in
      opposition to Amalgamated Soap. I am the more gratified, therefore, to
      find myself in some measure a colleague of so distinguished a coterie,
      even if I am admitted into but an outer temple, as it were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your gratification, Mr. Steele, is as nothing compared to my own at
      seeing you here amongst us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele bowed his acknowledgment. It was if the lion had begun by
      complimenting Daniel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I think the hour has struck,&rdquo; said the grave Farwell senior,
      taking his seat at the head of the long table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The directors ranged themselves on either side, Nicholson at the right
      hand of the chairman, Metcalfe next him, and the younger Farwell the third
      on that side. Opposite Nicholson sat John Steele, and beside him his two
      nominees. Thus quietly the lines of battle were formed and to all outward
      appearance the meeting resembled a love-feast. Bunches of papers were
      heaped before the chairman, while writing-pads, pens and ink were placed
      in front of each director. Steele, assuming a negligent, unconcerned air
      that was admirably put on, wondered what particular battery Nicholson
      would unmask. The latter&rsquo;s eyes were bent on his writing-pad, and he tried
      one nib after another, as if to find a pen to his satisfaction. The
      chairman, in droning voice, recited the history of the company up to its
      going before the public, read documents, and gave various figures which it
      might be supposed were familiar to all there assembled. There was silence
      around the table. Nicholson never looked up until the chairman announced
      the amount of public subscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Mr. Farwell?&rdquo; he asked quietly, raising his head. &ldquo;What are
      the figures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farwell repeated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how much do you say is the authorised capital of the company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farwell named the sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we are a million short?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly so, Mr. Nicholson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicholson&rsquo;s face became set and stern. Slowly he turned towards Metcalfe
      on his right hand, whose eyes shifted uneasily from one to another without
      ever resting on John Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood, sir,&rdquo; said Nicholson very slowly, as if weighing his words,
      &ldquo;that all the money was in the bank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you, sir,&rdquo; replied the hesitating Metcalfe, &ldquo;that there was in the
      bank all the capital we thought necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Necessary?&rdquo; echoed Nicholson, in cold, even tones. &ldquo;We make a demand upon
      the public. We state that the value of our property is so much. The public
      responds by offering us a million less. Necessary? I have never yet had
      anything to do with a company whose capital was not over-subscribed. I
      have never yet sanctioned the sending out of letters of allotment
      unaccompanied by letters of regret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele had difficulty in keeping the smile from his lips. The tones
      of righteous indignation were not in the least overdone. The expression of
      virtuous disapproval at being tricked, on the splendidly chiselled,
      clear-cut face, was marvellous in its reserve; in its hint of unlimited
      power behind. Steele felt, rather than saw, the uneasiness of the two
      colleagues by his side, who realised, without exactly understanding why,
      that things were going desperately wrong, like an engineer who sees an
      open bridge in front of him, and finds the brakes will not work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirably acted,&rdquo; said Steele to himself. &ldquo;We pay good money to visit the
      theatre, and yet there is such histrionic talent as this in the business
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then aloud, in a voice mildly protesting, he said: &ldquo;Nevertheless, Mr.
      Nicholson, the million shares left on our hands are quite marketable. We
      have ample capital to go on with, and Mr. Metcalfe will assure you that
      the factories themselves are all on a paying basis. You cannot surely mean
      that having arrived at this stage, we are not to proceed to allotment, Mr.
      Nicholson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I <i>do</i> mean,&rdquo; replied Nicholson, speaking as
      mildly as his opponent had done. &ldquo;My colleagues would never consent to
      admit connection with a company formed in the circumstances now before us.
      Our duty to the public&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Nicholson, I quite appreciate your position, and that of your
      colleagues, Mr. Peter Berrington and the rest. The public would indeed be
      shocked to learn that Peter, one of our religious pillars, could be guilty
      of anything in the least oblique. As cleanliness is next to godliness, we
      are all aware that Amalgamated Soap stands close to the Pearly Gates, and
      the only thing we fear about Peter is that when he gets to heaven he shall
      find another saint of the same name there before him, which may lead to
      confusion of identity. I take it for granted, Mr. Nicholson, that you are
      about to move a resolution requiring all this money to be returned to the
      subscribers. If you will propose such a motion, I shall be very happy to
      second it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An electric silence fell on the group, the kind of silence which on a hot
      summer&rsquo;s night precedes a clap of thunder. Nicholson drew a long breath
      and squared his shoulders. Metcalfe gazed in fascinated dismay at John
      Steele. Even the Farwells showed traces of human interest. Nicholson did
      not venture to challenge a vote. After a few moments of this embarrassing
      stillness he said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Mr. John Steele has something else to propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not,&rdquo; said Steele; &ldquo;but with the chairman&rsquo;s permission, there
      being no motion before the house, I should like to make a personal
      explanation which may save you future trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chairman nodded permission, and Nicholson said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be interested to hear anything you say, Mr. Steele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To return the money is, of course, to wreck the company. Hitherto this
      company has been associated with the names of John Steele and William
      Metcalfe. Tomorrow the sensation of the daily journals all over the
      country will be the collapse of the big scheme which those two men
      undertook to float. Mr. William Metcalfe is unknown in Chicago; is but a
      stool-pigeon well paid for the part he has enacted, and he disappears from
      the scene. John Steele stands the brunt. All the funds he possesses are in
      Amalgamated Soap&rsquo;s bank. His affairs are in the hands of Amalgamated Soap
      lawyers. One legal difficulty after another comes up; there is a long
      fight over the remains, and at last Amalgamated Soap steps in and sweeps
      up the <i>débris</i>. They are in possession of valuable property
      scattered throughout the West in the beet-sugar line; they announce their
      possession and the reconstruction of the company, and everything is
      beautiful, but John Steele is mangled in the collision, with no insurance,
      even for his relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I learned the other week that Mr. Nicholson was interested in this
      company, I felt like the man who had gone down into a cave and
      unexpectedly clutched a huge bear at the black bottom of it. That man did
      not stop to question the intentions of the bear; he simply got out. I
      followed his example. In the wheat deal Mr. Nicholson knows of, I made
      several millions, and ever since then certain capitalists in this city
      have begged me if I fell in with a similar good thing not to hug it all to
      myself, but allow them to come in on the ground floor, and I promised to
      do so. The moment I knew Mr. Nicholson was to have something to do with
      the beet-sugar project, I went directly to these capitalists, pledged them
      to secrecy, guaranteed that Amalgamated Soap was head and shoulders in
      this deal, and that no less a person than Mr. Nicholson himself would
      assume charge of the company. Gentlemen, they bit instantly. I sold out my
      share to them for the money it had cost me, and fifty per cent,
      additional; and, furthermore, I got the cash. Now I shall read you a
      letter which will appear in the Chicago newspapers to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the Editor:
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir&mdash;The Consolidated Beet Sugar Company, with which my name has
      hitherto been associated, and which has been so splendidly supported by
      Western capital, as indicated by the subscriptions now in the bank, will
      hereafter be in charge of the eminent financiers associated with
      Amalgamated Soap. I am pleased to state that this will be almost entirely
      a Chicago enterprise, and that some of the best men in this city have
      bought out my interests therein. I have only to add that Mr. Nicholson
      himself is now a member of the board of directors, and nothing further
      need be said to assure all concerned of the immense prosperity which
      awaits this company, and the far-reaching advantages it will offer both to
      agriculture and manufacture in the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      John Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Steele, as he folded up the copy of this letter
      and placed it in his inside pocket, &ldquo;nothing remains for me to do but to
      resign my seat on the board, as I have no longer the slightest interest in
      this company. But before handing in my formal resignation, I shall be
      pleased to second any motion Mr. Nicholson cares to propose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Nicholson, quite unruffled, &ldquo;I move we now proceed to
      allotment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have pleasure in seconding the motion,&rdquo; said John Steele, rising,
      bowing to the company, and leaving the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;PERSONALLY CONDUCTED BY A GIRL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>UGAR is a
      fattening product, and the Consolidated Beet Sugar Company waxed fat and
      prospered. Its shares stood high on the Stock Exchange, and the members of
      the syndicate to whom John Steele had sold his portion were exuberantly
      grateful to the young man for the opportunity he had given them. His
      reputation of possessing a keen financial brain was enhanced by the
      forming of this company; for it was supposed that it was he who had
      induced Amalgamated Soap to take it up. It was erroneously surmised that
      the great Peter Berrington and his colleagues had been so much impressed
      by Steele&rsquo;s genius in the wheat deal, where he was opposed to them, that
      they now desired the co-operation of this rising young figure in the
      commercial world. No hint of the momentary death-struggle in the
      board-room of the bank had ever leaked out through the solid doors. Steele
      was now one of the men to be counted with in the large affairs of the
      Western metropolis. Everything he touched was successful. Personally he
      was liked, and great social success might have been his had he cared for
      society, which he did not. He was commonly rated as being worth anywhere
      from six to ten millions, and the world looked upon him as the most
      fortunate of men. It did him no harm to be thought to enjoy the backing of
      the powerful Peter Berrington, and probably not more than half-a-dozen men
      knew that such was far from being the case. He did not bask in Peter&rsquo;s
      smile, but, on the contrary, shivered in his shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one man who had no delusions on the subject was John Steele himself.
      For the second time he had been entirely victorious over Nicholson and the
      gigantic coterie behind him; but this, strange as it may appear, gave him
      no satisfaction. If he had won the determined fight through his own
      superior skill, or because of some great display of mental power, he might
      have rested more at ease. Had that been the case, he would have awaited
      the next onslaught with more equanimity than he at present possessed; but
      he knew that his victory came to him through chance; chance multiplied
      again and again. It was chance that his partner had been out of his room
      when the messenger-boy brought the telegram. It was chance that Steele had
      opened the envelope. It was chance that he knew a man who could decode the
      cipher before it was too late for him to take action on the information it
      carried. After these three lucky throws of the dice, he admitted to
      himself that he had handled the situation with diplomatic success; but it
      disturbed him to remember that all his vigilance would have proved
      unavailing, had not pure luck stood his friend. Yet, after all, the
      initial mistake was Nicholson&rsquo;s, who should not have sent a cipher
      telegram to the office of the man he intended to destroy. Nicholson
      presumably did not know that his agent was actually housed with Steele,
      and it was a mistake on Metcalfe&rsquo;s part not to have furnished his chief
      with this information. But even putting the best face upon the matter, he
      could not conceal from himself the large part that luck had played in
      compassing his salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This never-lifted shadow of the silent Peter Berrington began to produce
      its effect upon him. He became timourous&mdash;afraid to venture in any
      large concern. He knew he was wasting time in pottering with small affairs&mdash;street
      railways in outside towns, the installing of electric light here and
      there, and such enterprises, which furnished only a moderate revenue to an
      enterprising speculator. Time and again he refused chances involving large
      amounts which turned out tremendously lucrative to the promoters, but
      which he had been afraid to touch, fearing the grip of Peter Berrington&rsquo;s
      unseen hand on his throat. He began to acquire the unexpected reputation
      of being an over-cautious capitalist, and finally well-known people, who
      formerly professed much admiration for him, ceased to come to his office
      with their schemes. Steele laughed uneasily to himself as he thought that
      Peter Berrington might perhaps accomplish his purpose by the gradual
      wearing down of his courage. Of course, the fact that a project became
      successful was no proof that the hand of Nicholson was not concealed
      somewhere within its intricacies to clutch at John Steele if he had become
      involved. He tried to shake off this depression, and once or twice plunged
      rather recklessly, only to become nervous before the climax arrived and
      sell out, sometimes at a small profit and sometimes at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he came to the conclusion that it was not Peter Berrington at all,
      or his shadow, that was affecting him, but the usual breakdown which
      afflicts strenuous business men in the stimulating atmosphere of a great
      American city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My nerve&rsquo;s gone; that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter with me,&rdquo; he said to himself.
      &ldquo;I must go and rough it for a summer in the mountains, or else take a trip
      to some spa in Europe. If I keep on like this, I shall be utterly useless
      in a live city like Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He consulted several of his friends&mdash;many of them, in fact&mdash;and
      told them he was feeling far from fit. His complaint was common enough,
      and every man to whom he spoke suggested a remedy. Some advised the
      plunging into dissipation at a fashionable health resort, and some
      recommended various medicinal springs in Europe which would work wonders;
      but the majority counselled him to take rod and gun, and get into the
      Rocky Mountains, camp out, and live like an Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; they said jocularly, smiting him on the back, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be all
      right, and come back yearning for scalps on the Stock Exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The newspapers mentioned the fact that John Steele was going into the
      Rockies to hunt and fish and camp out for a month or more to recover tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this interesting juncture that Alice Fuller called to see him.
      Now, John Steele was the most susceptible of men, and one reason he
      shunned society was because he knew he would surely fall a victim to the
      first designing pretty girl who laid a trap for him&mdash;if, indeed,
      pretty girls ever do lay traps for men said to possess from six to ten
      millions. His weakness in this line was exemplified by his impetuous
      proposal to Dorothy Slocum in the environs of Bunkerville, as has already
      been stated. But Alice Fuller was not the commonplace young person Dorothy
      Slocum had been. He often thought of his proposal to Dorothy with a
      shudder, and accounted it a narrow escape, which, indeed, it was not, for
      Dorothy was thoroughly devoted to her station-master, and never gave even
      a thought to Mr. John Steele of Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice Fuller was a blonde, and she brought in with her to the conventional
      private office of John Steele, with its extremely modern fittings of card
      indices, loose-leaf ledgers, and expanding office furniture, an air of
      breezy freshness that hinted of the mountainous West. Although dressed as
      any Chicago woman might be, there was, nevertheless, something about her
      costume which suggested the riding of mountain ponies and even the expert
      handling of a rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glory of a woman is her hair, and in truth Miss Fuller&rsquo;s golden
      tresses were glorious enough; but her eyes were the most distinguished and
      captivating features of a face sufficiently beautiful to attract attention
      anywhere. They were of a deep, translucent blue, darkening now and then
      into violet, like a pair of those limpid mountain lakes in the Rockies
      whose depths are said to be unfathomable. It was impossible to look into
      those honest orbs without trusting the clear purity of the soul behind
      them, and Steele, whose nerves were unstrung, almost shivered with
      apprehension when they were turned full upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord save me!&rdquo; he thought with a gasp. &ldquo;If this girl wants to sell shares
      in the most bogus company afloat, I&rsquo;m her victim. John Steele, if your
      bank account is to remain intact, now is the time to play St. Anthony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But aloud he said calmly enough: &ldquo;Pray be seated, madam,&rdquo; and she sank
      gracefully into a chair on the opposite side of the flat-topped desk
      behind which he was entrenched, although small protection the barricade
      afforded him against such artillery as a handsome young woman might bring
      to bear upon the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so good of you to see me,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I have read much of you
      in the newspapers, and I know that your time is valuable, so I shall take
      up as little of it as may be necessary to explain my business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow this remark, although only introductory sparring, disappointed
      young Mr. Steele. Nearly every stranger he met said the same thing in
      almost identical words. They all referred to his newspaper reputation, of
      which he was exceedingly tired, and nearly everyone spoke of the value of
      his time, promised not to encroach upon it, and then stayed for hours if
      they were permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My time is of little value at the present moment, Miss Fuller, because I
      am doing nothing. For some months past I have been rather out of health,
      and, in fact, within a few days I expect to leave Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;I saw that also in the papers. I read that you
      intended to go West among the mountains. Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such are my present intentions, but they are always liable to change. A
      man who is fighting his own nerves is rather capricious, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a woman,&rdquo; laughed Miss Alice. &ldquo;Well, it is on account of the
      statement in the Press that I am here. I have been thinking of calling
      upon you for a long time, but it appears we have no mutual friends who
      could give me an introduction, and so, seeing you were about to leave the
      city, I said to myself: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s now or never.&lsquo;The reference to the mountains
      struck me as a lucky omen. You know we women are rather superstitious, Mr.
      Steele, and I think it was that even more than your impending departure
      which gave me courage to venture up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad you came,&rdquo; said John Steele gallantly, &ldquo;and I shall be
      more than pleased if there is anything I can do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is the owner of a gold-mine in the Black Hills. Do you know
      anything of mines, Mr. Steele?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John slowly shook his head. The mere mention of a gold-mine did something
      to clarify his brain from the glamour that was befogging it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing whatever about mines, Miss Fuller, excepting the fact that
      more gold has been sunk in goldmines than has ever been taken out of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry to hear you say that,&rdquo; replied the girl, with a slight
      tremor of apprehension in her voice, &ldquo;and, furthermore, I do not in the
      least believe it to be true. Indeed, it cannot be true, because it is
      impossible to sink gold without first having mined it. Nothing can be more
      lucrative than a good gold-mine, for its product is one of the few things
      taken from the earth which do not fluctuate in value. With copper, or
      silver, or iron, you are dependent on the market; not so with gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a very eloquent advocate, Miss Fuller. Where is your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked up quickly at this sudden change of subject, and once more
      John fell under the fascination of those enchanting eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father? He is in Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Miss Fuller, the best plan will be to have him call upon me, and we
      can discuss the mine together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the young woman, with a mournful droop of the head, &ldquo;if that
      had been possible, I should not have been here. My father at the present
      moment is very ill and quite unable to discuss business with anyone. You
      are going from the city to the mountains in search of health. He has come
      from the mountains to the city on the same quest. The gold-mine is at once
      our hope and our despair. If it can be properly worked, we are certain it
      will produce riches incalculable; but it takes money to make money, and my
      father knows no wealthy people nor does he possess the necessary capital
      for the preliminary outlay. We are somewhat like King Midas, in danger of
      starving with gold all around us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the mine been opened, or is it only a prospective claim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the present moment there are from sixteen to twenty miners working
      upon it. The shaft, I believe, is something like a hundred feet deep, and
      one or two short galleries have been run. The ore assay is extremely rich;
      I have not the figures with me, but can easily bring them; and the reports
      are better and better as the miners proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be the case, Miss Fuller, I see no reason why you should lack for
      capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a hundred reasons, but one is sufficient. Every capitalist
      shuns a gold-mine. They speak just as you spoke a moment ago. Then, you
      see, our lives having been spent in the West, we know very few Eastern
      people, and those few have no money. The great difficulty is not in
      proving the wealth of the mine, but in getting a capitalist to listen. If
      you promise to listen, I shall undertake to prove to you that this is one
      of the most valuable properties in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Fuller, I am listening; but, as I told you, I know nothing
      whatever about gold-mines, and, indeed, am rather afraid of them. If the
      mine is producing ore in paying quantity, why does not your father have
      that ore crushed?&mdash;I suppose they could do that in the neighbourhood,
      or at Denver, or wherever the nearest mining town is&mdash;and with the
      product keep himself and pay his men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what he has done, Mr. Steele, and a ruinous thing it is
      to do. If it were not for that, we should have had to give up the struggle
      long ago. But there are no mines within miles of us, and we are two days
      and a half&rsquo;s journey from the nearest railway. Ore is bulky and heavy, and
      the transport alone over those mountain roads, which are not roads at all,
      and scarcely even paths, is at once slow and expensive. Railway freight is
      high, and when the ore gets to the reducing-plant, we have to take exactly
      what is given us, because beggars cannot be choosers. We need machinery at
      the mouth of the pit, and whoever will furnish the money for that
      machinery is sure to reap a rich reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless&mdash;&rdquo; protested John, but the girl interrupted him, her
      eyes aglow with fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised to listen, you know. There is another point I wish to put
      before you. The ore is very rich, and if we ship much of it, there is
      bound to be inquiry as to where it came from. Now, my father has been able
      to stake out only a comparatively small claim. If once it becomes known
      where this ore originates, there will be the usual rush. The rush is
      ultimately inevitable in any case, but my father is anxious to be fully
      secure before it comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, Miss Fuller,&rdquo; said John in a burst of
      enthusiasm, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a thousand dollars; and if you make money out
      of your mine, you can repay me at your leisure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alice Fuller slowly shook her golden head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not accept money in that way,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is like the giving
      of charity when a pathetic tale is told. Besides, a thousand dollars would
      be of no particular use; it would not purchase the stamp-mills, or
      transport them to the mine. In two months, or three, we should be just
      where we are now, and the thousand dollars would be gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, then, you wish me to do, Miss Fuller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish our transaction to be upon a sane business basis, and I don&rsquo;t want
      you to offer me a thousand dollars or twenty thousand dollars, or two
      hundred thousand dollars again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon. I had no thought of charity or anything of the sort
      when I made my proposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the girl, with a naïve confidence which
      Steele found very charming. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I wish to suggest. You are
      going to the mountains in any case. Very well, go to the Black Hills;
      there you will find the air pure and bracing; there are wild mountains and
      sparkling streams, and everything that a tired city man could desire. I
      want you to camp near our mine and investigate it thoroughly. If you are
      so satisfied with it as to justify the risk, I ask you to be prepared to
      buy a half share for three hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My purpose in going to the mountains is to get away from business, and
      not to take upon myself a new anxiety; to fish and shoot, not to pore over
      gold-bearing ore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you an enthusiastic sportsman, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I was too busy when I was young to indulge in such
      recreation, and too poor. Since then I have become busier still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And too rich?&rdquo; suggested the girl, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man is never too rich, I am afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are not an enthusiastic sportsman, a week in the woods will prove
      more than enough for you. After that comes boredom, and a yearning for the
      ticker and the morning newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I more than half believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Steele ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am right. Now, if you camp out beside the mine, you have
      something to interest you. Don&rsquo;t bother about it for the first week. There
      is plenty of shooting and fishing in the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to put two and a half days between me and a telegraph-wire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you had better leave mountains alone and stay in Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a very clever young lady, Miss Fuller, and I wonder you haven&rsquo;t
      made that gold-mine a success on your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am doing it now,&rdquo; she said with a flash almost of defiance from her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the young man laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You women have us at a disadvantage when you talk
      business, but I am going to get right down to plain facts, and speak to
      you as if you were your own brother. You won&rsquo;t be offended?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Do you know what a salted mine is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I thought you said you knew nothing of mines? A salted mine is
      one in which rich ore has been planted for the cheating of fools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An admirable definition, Miss Fuller. Well, in the matter of mines I&rsquo;m a
      fool, and a salted mine would take me in as a gold brick on State Street
      would delude an Illinois farmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then induce an expert to go with you&mdash;a mining expert who knows pay
      ore when he sees it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more distrustful of mining experts than of salted mines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose all faith has left Chicago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has&mdash;in gold-mines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Steele, I&rsquo;ll talk to you as if you were your own sister. Have
      you ever done a stroke of useful toil since you were born?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I worked on a railway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Go to the Black Hills and take a miner&rsquo;s outfit with you.
      Become for the time one of my father&rsquo;s workmen&mdash;or, rather, boss of
      the gang, if you like. Go into that mine, and direct them where they are
      to run the next level, and follow that level for a month, working with the
      men and keeping clear of the blasts. After you have penetrated a month in
      any direction you please, take the ore from the last blast and have it
      assayed. A mine can&rsquo;t be salted under those conditions. If that whole
      mountain is salted with gold, you&rsquo;d better buy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one can gainsay the honesty of that, Miss Fuller; but, to tell you the
      truth, I dread the two and a half days&rsquo; journey from the railway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to. I will be your guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried John, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you from the railway to the Hard Luck mine. Will you go?&rdquo; she
      demanded with a touch of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he cried, discretion struggling with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll go.
      Nothing would give me greater pleasure. But, then, on the other hand&mdash;you
      see&mdash;well&mdash;to speak quite frankly, for a young lady to&mdash;to,
      as one might say, journey across the plains&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, I know. You are talking now, not to my brother, as you
      remarked a while ago, but to my brother&rsquo;s sister. All my life I have had
      not only to take care of myself, but of my father as well. This project is
      a matter of vital importance to me, and I cannot allow it to fail merely
      because the rules of society would frown on what I intend to do. I shall
      take with me my own tent, and an old man who was in my father&rsquo;s employ
      long before I was born. This is a cold business deal, and no other
      consideration is going to enter into it. So let us brush aside every other
      consideration and come down to plain facts. You offered me a thousand
      dollars, and I refused it. If you will now give me the necessary money,
      which may be anything from two hundred dollars upwards, depending on what
      you want to take with you, I shall go at once to Pickaxe Gulch, which is
      the nearest railway station to the Hard Luck mine, and will collect what
      transport we need. There I shall await your coming. Do you intend to take
      any servants with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be accompanied by Sam Jackson, a negro man, who is the best cook
      in this town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, you will need a horse for him, and one for yourself; I shall
      need two horses; that&rsquo;s four. Then if you will give me an idea of the
      number of tents and boxes you require, I shall secure mules enough to
      carry them. We shall want two or three men to look after the mules, and
      you must give me a week at least to get this cavalcade together. Sometimes
      there are neither animals nor men at Pickaxe Gulch, but I intend to
      telegraph at once and secure whatever transport is available.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele smiled his appreciation of the capability displayed by the
      fearless young woman, opened his drawer, and took out a cheque-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we say five hundred dollars?&rdquo; he asked, looking across the desk at
      her. &ldquo;You must leave some money with your father, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred will be ample,&rdquo; she replied decidedly, and he wrote a cheque
      for that amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on in his life Steele remembered that demand for money with
      admiration. It was just one of those little points where a less subtle
      person than Miss Fuller would have made a mistake, deluded by success in
      getting him to promise to make the trip. But the young woman was evidently
      shrewd enough to know that after she left he would wonder, she having
      pleaded poverty, where the money came from to pay for so long a railway
      journey and at the same time provide for an ailing father at home. He
      always regarded that request for expenses as the climax of a
      well-thought-out plan.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;AN IMPORTANT CHAMPAGNE LUNCH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEN John Steele stepped down from the sleeping-car in the early morning
      at Pickaxe Gulch, he found Alice Fuller the sole occupant of the platform.
      She welcomed him with the cordiality of good comradeship. Her costume
      differed rather strikingly from the apparel she wore in his office. She
      reminded him of one of those reckless female riders he had seen at Buffalo
      Bilks Wild West Show, and he was forced to confess that the outfit suited
      her to perfection. She was even more attractive than when he had first
      seen her, and he could hardly have believed that possible. Before he
      ventured to compliment the young woman on her appearance, she complimented
      him on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are already looking very much better than you did in the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he cried jubilantly. &ldquo;Your visit did me ever so much good; and,
      besides that, I am now out from under Peter&rsquo;s shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Peter&rsquo;s shadow?&rsquo;&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;What is that? The shadow of a
      mountain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way, yes,&rdquo; laughed Steele, &ldquo;and a gold-producing mountain at that. I
      have been a rather anxious person these many months past; but now, whether
      it is the exhilaration of the air in the West, or the prospect&rdquo;&mdash;he
      hesitated a moment, then continued&mdash;&ldquo;of this journey, I am quite my
      own man once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without reply she led the way to the dusty road which ran between two rows
      of roughly built shanties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you breakfast on the train?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you might not have an opportunity to get anything to eat on the
      train, as it stops here so early, and I have ordered a meal for you at the
      one tavern in this place, which is far from being first-class. However,
      possibly, you can endure such a repast for once and then we will get on
      our way as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the cuisine of the West is no surprise to me,&rdquo; said Steele. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
      a good deal of experience with it in my time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked up the street together, the negro cook following and carrying
      Steele&rsquo;s valise. At the tavern the caravan was collected, and more than
      ever the resemblance to the Wild West Show impressed itself upon the young
      man. The boxes had been sent on some days ahead, and were now securely
      fastened to the backs of the mules. Four saddle-horses were tied to the
      rude pillars of the verandah. Steele went inside the building and partook
      of the breakfast, such as it was, and ten minutes later the procession
      started north.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their route lay across the plain, and during the forenoon the party
      traversed a road of sorts, reasonably well defined. In the horizon loomed
      low mountains, which did not seem perceptibly nearer when a halt was
      called by the side of a stream to prepare lunch. Steele was more
      accustomed to a street-car than to the back of a horse; but the way was
      level, and the horse developed none of those buck-jumping peculiarities
      which John, in his Eastern ignorance, had always associated with the
      steeds of the Far West. His business heretofore had never taken him away
      from a line of railway, and where it had been necessary to make a road
      journey, the jaunt was accomplished in some sort of vehicle. However, he
      soon became accustomed to his new method of locomotion and succeeded
      better than he had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice Fuller proved a most expert horse-woman, and her superb attitude in
      the saddle still further enslaved this ardent young man, who began to
      think he had never really lived until now. He was rather disappointed, but
      rendered none the less eager, to find that he was not getting as much of
      her company as he had hoped. In the beginning they rode side by side in
      front of the cavalcade, to be out of the dust which the mule train raised.
      But every now and then she wheeled her horse round and allowed the
      procession to pass her, scanning each animal and its burden with the eye
      of an expert, seeing that everything was in order. When Steele expressed
      admiration of her capability, Miss Fuller told him she had many times been
      in full charge of a similar expedition going or coming from the mine; and
      once when he complained of lack of companionship, she informed him that
      success depended a great deal on the first few hours of the march, and it
      was her duty to see that none of the animals fell lame, and that no burden
      shifted, thus causing a mule to lag behind its fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we shall be among the foothills, and even this
      afternoon we shall be free of the road and the dust. Then, if everything
      is going well, I may find plenty of time to talk to you, for I see you are
      anxious to learn more about the mine before you reach it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele threw a free-hearted laugh on the echoless air. Any little incident
      seemed now a fit subject for mirth. The clear atmosphere seemed as
      exhilarating as wine, and there was the further intoxicant of the girl&rsquo;s
      alluring presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lunch by the side of the stream more than made amends for the unattractive
      breakfast. The efficient Jackson had caused each of the numerous boxes to
      be numbered, and he began with Number One, which his master said was a
      very good thing to look after. He produced a portable stove, and a handful
      of coke performed miracles in the desert. It was soon evident that John
      Steele had no intention of starving while he wandered in the wilderness.
      He drew from its straw envelope a bottle of prime champagne, a drink which
      doubtless had never quenched thirst on that particular route before. Miss
      Fuller partook of the wine but sparingly, and lifted her glass when he
      proposed the toast of success to the expedition, thrilling him as she did
      so with those enthralling eyes of hers, and the young man began to wonder
      whether he actually saw heaven in their depths, or was looking at a desert
      mirage through an atmosphere of sparkling wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He persuaded her to linger after the cavalcade had moved on, saying they
      would overtake it at a gallop, and the young woman, with scarcely
      concealed reluctance, acquiesced. He threw himself full length at her feet
      and gazed up at her, while she watched, with the suggestion of a frown on
      her smooth brow, the procession lessening in the distance. He lit a
      cigarette, with her permission; and began the sort of conversation which a
      young man in the early stages of fascination is prone to indulge in. At
      first it seemed to him her thoughts were elsewhere, which was not in the
      least flattering to a person who was doing his best. On his chiding her
      for this, she drew a sharp breath and cast a glance upon him which he
      fancied was the reverse of friendly. It was veiled an instant after, and
      then, with something like a sigh, she appeared to accept the situation.

    <p>
      At this presaging of victory, John Steele&rsquo;s conscience began to trouble
      him. He guessed why she appeared so changeable. Her father&rsquo;s future and
      her own depended on the good-will of the young man stretched at her feet.
      She was anxious not to offend him, and yet her reluctance to remain alone
      with him, her absent-minded look, and the slight frown that now and then
      marred her brow, were hints that his attentions proved unwelcome. Steele
      surmised that any undue compliments or any too palpable indulgence in
      sentiment at this particular moment might prove disastrous to ultimate
      success. The resigned air with which she endeavoured to face a <i>tete-a-tete</i>
      not to her liking touched his pride, and also made him rather ashamed of
      himself for taking advantage of one who in the circumstances was helpless.
      He wondered if he could put this girl more at ease by telling her he had
      quite made up his mind to finance the mine, whether it proved all she said
      or the reverse. Yet she might regard this statement as merely an
      unblushing bid for her preference, for she knew that until he had examined
      the mine any such avowal would be made merely because he thought it would
      please her. While these thoughts ran through his mind, a silence had
      fallen between them, which, however, the girl appeared not to notice, for
      her eyes were fixed on the distant mountains. She was quite startled by
      the suddenness with which he sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Fuller,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I see you are anxious to be off towards the
      hills, and it is selfish of me to detain you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand to her and helped her up. She smiled very sweetly and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is time we were on our way again. We have further to go than
      you suspect, before we reach the regular camping-ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had reason to congratulate himself on his intuition, for during that
      journey she was kinder to him than she had ever been before, as if anxious
      to make up for her former coldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had gone down ere they reached the halting-station for the night.
      They were now on an elevated plateau among the hills, and an impetuous
      torrent near by gave forth the only sound that broke the intense
      stillness. Tents were pitched, horses and mules tethered, and Jackson set
      out a dinner which their keen appetites made doubly memorable. Night came
      down, and the moon rose gloriously in the east. Time and place were ideal
      for a lovers&rsquo; meeting, but the adage which intimates that luck with gold
      does not run parallel with luck in love proved true in this instance.
      Immediately after partaking of the excellent coffee Jackson had brewed,
      the young woman rose and held out her hand, pleading fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must bid you &lsquo;Good night,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! won&rsquo;t you stay a little while and enjoy this unexampled moonlight? It
      seems as if I had never seen the moon before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman smiled wanly, but shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really very tired,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I have had a week of it at that
      awful hotel in the Gulch. It is fearfully noisy at night with drinking
      cowboys and miners, and so I have had scarcely any sleep for a long while.
      If I have proved a dull companion to-day, that is the reason, and I am
      sure you will excuse me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Fuller, you could not be dull if you tried. I am sorry you should
      have had so much trouble on my account at that terrible station. I should
      have sent a man, but I could not guess the horrors of the place before
      seeing it. Pray forgive my selfishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was really nothing. I am quite accustomed to the life; but,
      somehow, the first night in the mountains always leaves me stupid and
      drowsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow night, then,&rdquo; he said very quietly, &ldquo;we may perhaps view the
      moonlight together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow night,&rdquo; she murmured and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steele threw himself into the canvas camp-chair, and, reclining, gazed on
      the moonlit plain below and listened to the roar of the torrent. Dreamily
      he fancied himself floating in the seventh heaven of bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning the camp was early astir, for a long day of mountaineering
      lay ahead. The party numbered seven, all told, there being three men of
      peaceable demeanour, but rough aspect, in charge of the pack-train. At no
      time during that day did Steele secure an opportunity of speaking with
      Alice Fuller alone. They could not ride together, as the mountain path was
      too narrow. After dinner, at the final camping-place, a wild spot in a
      profound valley, where John saw with dismay the moon would not be visible,
      the girl seemed loth to keep him company as had been the case the night
      before. She laughed somewhat harshly, he thought, when he complained that
      she must have known they could not see the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can study its rays on the northern peaks,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who would ever
      have expected a modern financier to yearn for the moon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A modern financier is but a man, after all,&rdquo; protested Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sometimes doubted it,&rdquo; replied the girl cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Fuller, if you will sit down again, even in the absence of
      moonlight, I think I can remove your doubts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood there hesitating for a few moments, but it was too dark to see
      the expression on her face. Finally she sat down in the chair from which
      she had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am seated,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but not to talk of moonlight, merely to tell you
      that I intend to go no farther. To-morrow morning we bid &lsquo;Good-bye&rsquo; to
      each other. You go north, and I go south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say,&rdquo; cried John reproachfully, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s contrary to contract. You
      promised to lead me to the mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I did; but it is always a woman&rsquo;s privilege to change her mind.
      Perhaps you will understand I do not wish to influence you at all in the
      decision you may come to about the mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it make you abjure your cruel resolve if I informed you that I have
      quite determined to invest in the mine if it gives any show of success,
      which I am sure it will do from what you have told me about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mine must plead its own cause,&rdquo; she said, with an indifference that
      amazed him. &ldquo;You have no real need of me as a guide, for the three men I
      engaged know the route as well as I do. They have been over it often
      enough. I am really very anxious about my father. He promised to telegraph
      me at Pickaxe Gulch, but has not done so. I sent a despatch the day before
      you arrived, but no reply came, and it may be waiting for me now at the
      office there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not send back one of the men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of my own anxiety. I fear the telegram may call me to his side. I
      think you will understand now why I have been distraught while in your
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Fuller, believe me, I am very sorry to hear that this worry has been
      hanging over you. If I had known, I should have proposed our remaining at
      Pickaxe Gulch until you had heard from your father. I fear my own conduct
      and conversation may have added to your discomfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no,&rdquo; said the girl, quickly rising again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you accept this trifle from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke hurriedly, and took from his waistcoat pocket something that she
      knew to be a ring, for even in the dim light it sparkled as if fire were
      playing from its facets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; she replied, stepping back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will bind you to nothing&mdash;nothing at all. It is simply to keep me
      in your memory until we next meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shall never forget you!&rdquo; she cried, in a tone of bitterness that
      startled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a mere trinket,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;and I bought it for you before I left
      civilisation. If you do not accept it, I shall throw it into the darkness
      of the valley yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be foolish, even for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Fuller, such a remark has a very dubious sound. What do you
      mean by it? Do you think I am foolish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think anything at all of either you or your folly. I tell you
      I merely want to get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take the ring with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood for a long time with head bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it makes any difference one way or the other,&rdquo; she said
      at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it doesn&rsquo;t. I told you it wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I shall take the ring, if you will accept a much cheaper and
      more significant present from me in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall accept gratefully anything you like to give me, Miss Fuller, in
      the morning or at any future time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; was all her comment, as she took the ring and instantly
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow this night held none of the glamour that distinguished the
      previous evening. The depth of the profound shadows surrounding him was
      merely emphasised by the touch of cold moonlight on the hilltops far away.
      John wondered if the exhilarating effect of the atmosphere had departed,
      leaving him sober again. He felt strangely depressed, and although he
      immediately entered his tent and flung himself, dressed as he was, upon
      his canvas cot, he found it difficult to sleep. It was after midnight
      before he dozed off, and then his slumber was troubled and uneasy. Towards
      morning, however, a kind of stupor descended upon him, leaving him
      dreamless and lost to the world. This was broken by a sharp and angry
      voice, whose meaning did not at first reach his consciousness; but the
      sentence lingered in his awakening mind and at last became clear to him,
      as an image comes out during the gradual development of a photographic
      plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I will not leave until I bid &lsquo;good-bye&rsquo; to Mr. Steele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Alice Fuller&rsquo;s voice, and in an instant the young man was on his
      feet and out of the tent. Day had just dawned, gray and chill, but already
      the camp was astir and the young woman in her saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you call me?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered; but he seemed to detect a tremor of fear in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I heard you say you wished to bid &lsquo;goodbye&rsquo; to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been dreaming. But I do wish to bid you &lsquo;good-bye.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two of the muleteers stood near, and the old attendant, mounted, had
      already started slowly on his way. John sprang to her side, and as he came
      to a stand by the horse, she stooped and slipped a small box into his coat
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye! good-bye!&rdquo; she cried somewhat boisterously, with an exclamation
      that seemed to be half sob and half laugh. &ldquo;Go back to your tent at once
      and brush your hair. It&rsquo;s enough to frighten anyone,&rdquo; and now she laughed
      with unnecessary vehemence, the near mountains echoing the peal with a
      strange mocking cadence that sent a chill up the spine of one listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he asked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man at the bridle turned the horse&rsquo;s head towards the distant railway,
      and the other smote the steed on the flank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go my horse!&rdquo; commanded Miss Fuller savagely. The man slouched away.
      She touched the animal with her heel and galloped off, while Steele stood
      in a daze watching her. Only once she looked back, then made a quick
      motion to the pocket of her jacket and disappeared round the ledge of
      rock. Jack remembered the packet she had dropped into his pocket, and
      imagining her gesture might have reference to that, walked to his tent to
      examine the present so surreptitiously given him, remembering that she had
      said the night before it would prove more significant than the ring she
      had so reluctantly accepted. It was a little, square parcel, tied in a bit
      of newspaper with a red string. He whisked this off, and held in his hand
      a box of white metal. Opening the box he saw within it a simple cake of
      soap!
    </p>
    <p>
      Steele held this on his open palm, gazing at it like one hypnotised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he groaned at last, &ldquo;soap&mdash;Amalgamated Soap! Peter
      Berrington and Nicholson! Trapped, as I am a fool and a sinner! These
      muleteers are the real chiefs of this expedition. They saw Alice Fuller
      weakening; but she weakened too late, and now they have sent her away.
      What&rsquo;s the object of all this? It is too fantastic to imagine that
      Nicholson supposes he can exact all I possess as ransom. Even the Black
      Hills are not the mountains of Greece. What is it, then? Murder? That&rsquo;s
      equally incredible, and yet possible. Here am I unarmed, rifles in the
      boxes, no one with me but a cowardly nigger. Walked right into the trap
      with my eyes open, like a gaping idiot! Well, John Steele, you deserve all
      you will get! Let&rsquo;s discover what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strode out of the tent. The negro was preparing breakfast. The three
      men stood in a group together, talking, but they looked round and became
      silent as he approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have changed my mind,&rdquo; said Steele; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going back to the railway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, we&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said one of the men, stepping forward, and taking a
      revolver from his hip pocket; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going on to the mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a mine?&rdquo; asked Steele, with a sneering laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a mine all right enough, and they&rsquo;re waiting for you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out about twelve o&rsquo;clock to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, boys,&rdquo; said Steele persuasively, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you three the
      richest men in this part of the country if you&rsquo;ll accompany me safely back
      to the railway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard that kind of talk before,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;and have had
      enough of it. You tell that to the boss of the gang at the mine; and
      whatever he says, we&rsquo;ll agree to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but at the mine&mdash;How many are there, by the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see when you reach the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, even if there&rsquo;s one more, he divides the loot with you. You can
      make better terms with me now than you can at the mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chuck it, stranger. There ain&rsquo;t no use giving us any more taffy. You&rsquo;re
      going on to the mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Steele, turning on his heel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have breakfast first.
      Is the coffee ready, Jackson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner sat down at the collapsible table and enjoyed a hearty meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon they reached the mine, and a dozen, gaunt, wild-eyed men, who were
      sitting round, stood up when the riders came into sight. They gave no
      cheer when they saw the captive, nor did their attitude of listless, bored
      indifference change a particle as Steele stopped his horse and dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the goods,&rdquo; said the leader of the muleteers, and the boss of the
      mining gang nodded, but made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, gentlemen,&rdquo; began Steele, a smile coming to his lips in spite
      of the seriousness of the crisis, as he thought that this sombre, silent
      gang in the midst of the mountains bore a comical resemblance to the
      gnomes in Rip Van Winkle when that jovial inebriate appeared amongst them.
      &ldquo;I take it, sir, that you are leader here, and I think there has been some
      mistake. During today&rsquo;s journey I have been forced to travel to this mine
      against my will. You seem to have been expecting me. Now, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be, in about ten minutes,&rdquo; replied the boss. &ldquo;Dakota Bill, where&rsquo;s
      your rope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Bill, stepping forward and exhibiting a slip-noose at
      the end of about thirty feet of stout line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, stranger, if you&rsquo;ve got any messages to leave your friends, we&rsquo;ll
      give you ten minutes to write or say them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no messages, thank you, but I am disturbed by a lively curiosity to
      know what all this means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course you&rsquo;ve no suspicion about what it means, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never saw your mine before, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d say that. Well, now, we&rsquo;ve been left here for four months
      without a markee of pay. For the last month we would have starved if it
      hadn&rsquo;t been for Dakota Bill&rsquo;s good work with a rifle; but even the game
      has fled from this accursed place and now we <i>are</i> starving. You&rsquo;re
      the man responsible, and you know it. We&rsquo;ve sworn to hang you, and we&rsquo;re
      <i>going</i> to hang you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, your statement is definite and concise, without being as
      illuminating as I should like. A mistake has been made, of which I am the
      innocent victim. You are the victims, too, for that matter; because, after
      all, it is not a mistake, but a conspiracy. I can see, however, that
      nothing I may say will mitigate the situation in the slightest degree. I
      shall, therefore, not indulge in useless declamation. Three things are
      fixed. I am the owner of this mine. I have cheated you out of your pay for
      four months, therefore I am to be hanged. There comes into my mind at this
      moment something I have read somewhere about hangings at Newgate prison in
      England. They drop a man, then all concerned go at once to enjoy what is
      called the &lsquo;hanging breakfast.&rsquo; The gruesomeness of such a proceeding
      fastened the item in my mind. Let&rsquo;s have a &lsquo;hanging lunch.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger, as I understand your remarks, the person turned off didn&rsquo;t
      attend that breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, stranger, we&rsquo;ll look after the lunch when you&rsquo;re strung up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, excuse me, the victim had a hearty breakfast <i>before</i> he was
      hanged. Now, I beg to point out to you that I drank my coffee just about
      daybreak this morning, and since then I&rsquo;ve travelled over the worst set of
      mountains it has ever been my privilege to encounter. I&rsquo;m as hungry as a
      bear. I therefore insist on your lunching with me, and I shall give you a
      meal such as you wouldn&rsquo;t better at the Millionaire&rsquo;s Club. Before I left
      home, six manufacturers of portable stoves insisted on my accepting one
      each, in the hope of getting an unsolicited testimonial. I shall leave the
      stoves with you, and trust you will recommend them to your friends. I
      don&rsquo;t need them where I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said one of the party, &ldquo;they&rsquo;d melt there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Jackson,&rdquo; cried Steele enthusiastically, &ldquo;set up the whole six
      stoves. You&rsquo;ve got to cook dinner for the party. But, meanwhile, open some
      of those boxes of new sardines with the trimmings on, which they&rsquo;ve just
      sent across to us from Brittany. A little caviare also may be a novelty in
      this district. I think we&rsquo;ve plates enough to go round. If not, use
      saucers or the tins. Gentlemen, I take it you don&rsquo;t need an appetiser, but
      what will you drink before we begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit, stranger, you&rsquo;re a mighty plausible cuss, and we expected that;
      but you don&rsquo;t palaver this crowd. There&rsquo;s no drinking till after the
      ceremony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time there was a murmur of disapproval at this, but the
      leader held up his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, you fellows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to deal with a pretty
      slippery customer. You know what them city men are. Now, there&rsquo;s no
      drinking till after the performance; you hear me. I&rsquo;d string him up this
      moment, only we&rsquo;d scare his cook white, and then we&rsquo;d have to eat things
      raw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jackson handed round sardines and other tempting extras, while Steele put
      the collapsible table on its legs and opened various boxes, from one of
      which he took out a case of champagne, and another of Scotch whisky. Then,
      getting a large pitcher which had been intended as the water-holder of his
      tent, he poured two bottles of Scotch whisky into it, followed by bottle
      after bottle of champagne until the jug was full. Meanwhile the busy negro
      had got the six stoves ablaze, and the appetising smell that came from the
      utensils over the fires made the starving miners oblivious to everything
      else. The first course was devoured in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although you may not care to consume intoxicating liquors, and I quite
      agree with you that it is best to keep sober, I hope you have no objection
      to temperance drinks. Who&rsquo;ll have some cider?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cider?&rdquo; said the leader. &ldquo;Have you got any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pitcher full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Pour it out. I wish you had brought beer instead. We&rsquo;d
      risk beer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, you can risk the cider. I&rsquo;m sorry I haven&rsquo;t any beer,&rdquo; and,
      hungry as he was, the young man himself poured out full glasses to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By jiminy crickets!&rdquo; cried the leader, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the best cider I ever
      tasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the very best cider made in this country,&rdquo; said Steele earnestly,
      &ldquo;and thank goodness, I&rsquo;ve got plenty of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As course after course was served, and bumper after bumper was drunk, the
      geniality of the crowd rose and rose, until Steele at last saw he could
      possibly make terms with them, but he resolved not to chance that. He
      determined to leave them so drunk that none could move; then he would
      depart at his leisure. Under the exhilarating effects of the mixture he
      poured out, all objections to intoxicating liquor fled from the jovial
      assemblage, and Jackson now opened whisky bottle after whisky bottle. The
      miners were laughing, singing, weeping on one another&rsquo;s necks, utterly
      oblivious of mine owners, lack of pay, lynching, or anything else, when
      Steele and Jackson mounted their horses, the coloured cook leading one of
      the mules laden with provisions ample for a week&rsquo;s journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Steele reached Pickaxe Gulch, he thought he never should be so glad
      to see a pair of rails again. He felt like throwing his arms round the
      neck of the station-master, but instead asked that rough diamond if there
      were any news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not much,&rdquo; replied the station-master, &ldquo;except that Peter Berrington,
      the billionaire, is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; fervently ejaculated Steele, to the astonishment of the
      station-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the official, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone where his money won&rsquo;t do him no good.
      Found dead in his chair in his office in New York, two days ago. There&rsquo;s
      the paper, if you want to read about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steele went in and possessed himself of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he muttered, as he gazed at the big, black headlines. &ldquo;He or
      his system sent a man to death when he ought to have been preparing for
      death himself. That&rsquo;s as it should be. Thank goodness the shadow has
      lifted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele forgot the words of Shakespeare:=

      CHAPTER XV&mdash;AN ATTEMPT AT AN ARMISTICE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>OHN STEELE&rsquo;S
      friends were amazed to find him back in town almost within a week after he
      had left with such lavish preparations for a long stay in the wilderness.
      It was difficult for him to offer an adequate explanation, and it grew to
      be most annoying, once he had constructed his excuses, to be compelled to
      repeat them to every friend he met, and listen without cursing to the
      inane advice given by people who didn&rsquo;t in the least know what they were
      talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! back already?&rdquo; cried Philip Manson, who had offered to place a
      private car at his disposal if he would keep close to the railway. Manson
      held that camping out in a private car was the right way to do it, and
      that a canvas tent was a delusion and a snare. &ldquo;Back already?&rdquo; exclaimed
      the general manager. &ldquo;Why, John, you look as haggard as if you&rsquo;d been
      through a panic in the wheat market. Didn&rsquo;t the Black Hills agree with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said John shortly and truthfully; &ldquo;threatened to develop throat
      trouble,&rdquo; and he tapped his neck significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long were you in the mountains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I told you how it would be before you left. That&rsquo;s what comes
      of sleeping in a cot-bed, over damp ground, under thin canvas. You should
      have taken both my advice and my private car then you could have carried
      all the comforts of town with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that the immediate tension of the crisis had relaxed, John Steele
      found himself very close to a mental and physical collapse. It was true
      that the great Peter Berrington was dead, but the elation which that
      startling piece of news had first caused subsided long before he reached
      the city. Men die, but systems remain. Had the shadow of Peter Berrington
      been lifted, after all, even though Peter himself was now a shadow? The
      grotesque uncertainty of the situation was making rags of John Steele&rsquo;s
      nerves. Even as he walked through the crowded streets he had to fight down
      an impulse to shriek aloud, raising his hands to heaven and crying: &ldquo;In
      God&rsquo;s name, if you&rsquo;re going to do anything, do it <i>now</i>, and let&rsquo;s
      have it over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not that he shrank from ruin, or even from death, both of which he
      had faced within the past year. It was the uncertainty of when and how the
      blow was to fall. He began to fear that something worse than either ruin
      or death would overtake him. In the privacy of his own room he would
      sometimes march up and down with set teeth and clenched fists, saying to
      himself: &ldquo;You must quit thinking of this, or you&rsquo;ll go mad,&rdquo; and yet with
      all his strength of mind he could not stop his planning to circumvent the
      unseen danger which threatened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fantastic nature of the peril that surrounded him was such that if it
      were made public, he would be laughed at from one end of the country to
      the other. In a busy, practical, work-a-day world, it was incredible that
      a group of men, only one of whom he had ever seen, and that most casually,
      should sit in a sky-scraper in New York and actually plan the murder of a
      young man in Chicago; for this group of men were churchgoers,
      Sunday-school teachers, philanthropists who had founded colleges;
      bestowers of charity on a scale of munificence hitherto unexampled. And
      yet more potent than all these things was the fact that they were
      hard-headed business men, the most successful business men in the world,
      intent on their own affairs, and naturally far removed from any thought of
      revenge, for the simple reason that revenge is not business, and there is
      no money in it. It was quite true that this same group, in early days, had
      been accused of burning rival factories, of inciting riots, and of many
      other crimes against the peace and security of the commonwealth, but these
      things had never been legally proven or brought home to the group by
      irrefutable evidence. Where investigation had followed crime, and the
      inquiry was not quashed, it had always been shown that the rash acts were
      the work of over-zealous employees exceeding their instructions. The hands
      of the financial group in the tall building on Broadway were clean. No
      band of Quakers were more set against violence than these mild-mannered
      men in New York. If John Steele had told the story of the attempted
      lynching among the Black Hills, the incredulous public would have looked
      upon the affair as a practical joke played by humourous mountaineers on a
      tenderfoot from the East. No one knew better than John Steele that to
      connect Dakota Bill of the Black Hills with Nicholson of New York was an
      impossibility. He was certain the miners knew nothing of Nicholson; that
      they held a genuine lynching grievance against the owner of the mine,
      whoever he was, and that they were acting quite naturally according to
      their instincts when this supposed owner had fallen into their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice Fuller, who led him so easily into the trap, as the tame animal in
      the stockyards leads its fellows to the slaughter-pen&mdash;she, of
      course, knew for whom she was acting, but John doubted if this knowledge
      led by any followable clue to Nicholson. When he thought of the handsome
      girl, he shuddered; and, for ten thousand reasons, that episode must never
      become public. To be hoodwinked by a pretty woman was merely to join the
      procession of fools that extended from the time of Adam to the year 1905.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult for Steele to cease his thoughts of the Amalgamated Soap
      combination, for the papers continued full of Peter Berrington and the
      financial upheaval which his sudden death was certain to cause. The
      imagination of the world was touched by the fact that this tremendous
      power which Peter Berrington had wielded in ever-increasing force for
      nearly half a century now lapsed into the hands of a girl, Constance
      Berrington, aged twenty-four, the only child of the billionaire. The
      newspapers printed column after column about this young lady, who appeared
      to be even more of a recluse than her father was. They published portraits
      of her, no two alike&mdash;pictures ranging from the most beautiful woman
      in Christendom to the most gaunt and ugly hag; which seemed to indicate
      that photographs of Miss Constance were unobtainable, and that the artists
      drew on their imagination as well as on their Whatman pads. She avoided
      society, was never seen at such resorts as Newport or Lenox; she took no
      part in the festivities of a great city, and believed that the door of a
      theatre was the gate of hell. Gossip said she was haunted by a fear of
      being married for her money, and so at this early age had become a
      man-hater. It was also alleged that she kept a conscience, a possession
      with which her father had never been credited even by the wildest
      imaginative writer. She was going to devote her life and her billions as
      far as possible to the undoing of the harm which her parent had
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is fanatically religious,&rdquo; proclaimed one newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a plain, commonplace girl,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;whose father has
      bequeathed her his cash, but not his brains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When John Steele found he could not cease thinking over his paralysing
      situation, which had entirely emasculated his initiative and wrecked his
      business career; when he feared lunacy awaited him, he resolved to meet
      this girl, and persuade her, if he could, to stop the huge, golden
      Juggernaut which threatened to crush the life or reason out or him. Yet it
      seemed cowardly for a grown man to make such an appeal to a young girl who
      was an entire stranger to him, and who, if he actually succeeded in
      reaching her presence, would most likely consider herself insulted that
      such crimes as he placed before her without the slightest proof, should be
      attributed to her father. Thus the interview would doubtless end with his
      being turned out of the house by the servants. Then again, even if she
      believed him&mdash;and the chances were only as one in ten thousand&mdash;did
      she possess the actual as well as the nominal power to stop the
      persecution? Was she like the Czar of Russia, helplessly at the head of an
      organisation over whose movements the supposed chief had no control?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, after all, Steele had not gone so far towards insanity as to be in
      any error regarding the real mover in the conspiracies of which he was the
      victim. Nicholson was the man; there could be no doubt of that. Twice
      Steele had beaten Nicholson to the ground. In the great wheat deal he had
      exposed his treachery and dishonesty; had publicly shown him to be an
      unscrupulous scoundrel; had prevented him from making millions in a single
      coup, which was all prepared and certain to succeed had not Steele
      disarranged the machinery. He had humiliated the man personally, wounding
      his pride and crushing his self-esteem. Was it possible, then, ever to
      make terms with one naturally so embittered? Steele braced himself and
      resolved to try. Twice he had defeated him, and there remained in John&rsquo;s
      hand the powerful weapon of publicity. After all, could Amalgamated Soap
      risk such an exposure as it was in Steele&rsquo;s power to cast forth to the
      eager Press of the country? Was it so certain that the public would not
      believe the story he might tell regarding Amalgamated Soap? Even though
      Nicholson was imbued with malice, his colleagues would be more reasonable,
      more amenable to persuasion. They would undoubtedly try to induce this
      angry man to refrain from tempting the avalanche. He resolved to propose a
      treaty of peace with Nicholson. Then came the doubt. Should Nicholson
      agree to such a pact, would he keep it? Would he merely use it as a
      sedative to lull his intended victim into false security? Such an outcome
      was very likely; still, a frank talk with Nicholson could do no harm, and
      Steele had not the slightest intention of being lulled into security by
      anything Nicholson might say. Recalling to his mind the stony countenance
      of that human sphinx, Steele could not delude himself that any appeal to
      conscience or any plea for mercy would have the least chance of success.
      Nicholson was as unemotional as the Pyramids; Steele could make no bargain
      with such a man unless he had something to offer. Therefore he did not go
      impetuously to New York and fling himself at the feet of Nemesis, the
      divinity of chastisement and vengeance. He set about the preparation of
      the goods he would trade with, this white Indian. It gratified him to
      think that after all these months of doubt and uncertainty he could at
      last come to a definite decision about anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no women in John Steele&rsquo;s office. His confidential stenographer
      was a quiet man, a little older than himself, named Henry Russell. Steele
      touched an electric button on his desk, and Russell came in, notebook in
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Russell. If I remember rightly, you were connected with a
      newspaper in your early days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a very humble capacity, sir; I was merely a reporter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;merely.&rsquo; A reporter is ever so much more important than an
      editorial writer. Have you ever attempted a novel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, you know something of literary form and the way a book is put
      together, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about the writing of books, sir. I think I have a fair
      knowledge of how a sentence should read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the main thing. Still, as a reporter you must have seen a
      good deal of the seamy side of life, and later you have had to do with
      important business affairs, ever since you came into my employ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very true, Mr. Steele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you could concoct the plot of a novel? A novel of
      every-day business life, let us say, like one of those that have been so
      successful lately&mdash;a book pulsating with the greed of gold, and all
      that sort of thing, you know? Unscrupulous men, and perhaps an adventuress
      here and there, of perfectly stunning beauty. For instance, someone
      resembling that girl who came in to see me a fortnight ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y es, I remember her. She was good looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An amazing beauty, I thought her,&rdquo; said Steele, thrusting his hands into
      his trousers pockets and marching up and down the room. &ldquo;Well, couldn&rsquo;t
      such a belle of the markets as that inspire you towards the writing of a
      great work of fiction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Russell shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, Mr. Steele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing much doing just now,&rdquo; continued the promenading man. &ldquo;At
      this present moment I intended to be off on my vacation, but I found the
      mountains too exciting&mdash;er&mdash;too dull I mean&mdash;and so you see
      I am back among you earlier than I expected. Now, Russell, between
      ourselves, there is nothing more absurd than for a successful business man
      to attempt the writing of a novel. Yet I&rsquo;m the sort of person who cannot
      remain idle, and there is nothing in sight to do for a month or two. I&rsquo;m
      going to while away the time by composing a business novel, and I want you
      to assist me. I&rsquo;ll dictate the thing straight off to you, and you must
      invent the names and kick the sentences into shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And remember, Russell, of all the confidential transactions you&rsquo;ve been
      called upon to perform, this is the one in which I demand the utmost
      secrecy. I should be the laughing stock of the town if it once got out
      that I were plunging into fiction instead of into wheat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never breathe a whisper of it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you won&rsquo;t, and that is why I trust you. Now, we&rsquo;ll just lock
      the doors and refuse ourselves to all comers. If a novel is to be a
      success nowadays, when people have so much to read and so little time for
      reading, it must be as sensational as possible, and I think I can do the
      trick. Anyhow, if it fails, there&rsquo;s no great harm done, and for a time we
      two will court that seclusion with which, I read in the papers, all true
      literary men surround themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men worked together day after day, until the first draft of the
      history was completed and typed; then they revised this copy very
      thoroughly, and Steele directed that duplicates should be made, with
      blanks left for all proper names. He professed himself dissatisfied with
      the titles they had invented, and said that while the final manuscript was
      being prepared, he would concoct more suitable appellations for his main
      characters, and insert them with his own hand. This final revision was
      accomplished by John Steele alone, when he inserted the real names; then
      with his own hand he wrote the following letter to Stoliker, editor of the
      <i>Daily Blade</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>My dear Stoliker:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>If the accompanying manuscript ever comes into your possession, I want
      you first of all to remember that on a certain night I brought to you a
      most remarkable article regarding the wheat situation in this country, the
      truth of which you quite legitimately doubted. After-events proved the
      accuracy of my statement, and you were thus enabled to score a great
      triumph for your paper. Believe me, then, when I tell you that every word
      here typed is true; for when you read the accompanying pages, I shall not
      be by your side to use arguments in favour of its publication. I shall
      either have disappeared, or, more probably, I shall be dead. In either
      case, this manuscript, every name in which is real, will give you a clue
      to the disaster which has overtaken me. In the meantime I remain, Your
      friend,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>John Steele.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter and the manuscript he wrapped up into a parcel, which he
      securely sealed. On the outside he wrote instructions that in the case of
      his death or disappearance the package was to be handed intact to
      Stoliker, of the <i>Daily Blade</i>. The other package, with a duplicate
      of the letter to Stoliker, was placed in the vault of a depository,
      supposed to be the greatest strong-room in the city, which, he afterwards
      learned with some amusement, belonged to Amalgamated Soap. The thin key
      and the code word which opened this receptacle he placed in a sealed
      envelope which he left in the hands of his legal advisers, with
      instructions to forward the envelope to Stoliker in case of his death or
      disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this accomplished to his satisfaction, he took the Limited to New
      York, and entered the tall building on Broadway which was body to the
      brain that directed the activities of Amalgamated Soap. Asking that his
      card should be taken to Mr. Nicholson, and replying to an inquiry that he
      had no appointment, he was taken into a small but richly furnished
      waiting-room, which he saw to be one of many on the eleventh floor, and
      there he rested for nearly half an hour before a messenger entered and
      announced that Mr. Nicholson would be pleased to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholson&rsquo;s room was large and sumptuous, with several windows opening on
      Broadway. The two financiers, big and little, met on the plane of ordinary
      politeness, without any effusion of mutual regard on the one hand, or
      evidence of mutual distrust on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have called,&rdquo; said Steele, &ldquo;to see if we can come to any workable
      arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what line of activity?&rdquo; asked Nicholson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a line of passivity rather than of activity,&rdquo; explained Steele, with a
      smile. &ldquo;When I was a youngster, and engaged in a fight, it was etiquette
      that as soon as the under boy hollered &lsquo;Enough!&rsquo; the fellow on top ceased
      pummelling him. I have come all the way from Chicago to cry &lsquo;Enough!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicholson&rsquo;s eyebrows raised very slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I do not understand you, Mr. Steele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you do. It will save time and talk, if we take certain things
      for granted. When we first met, I was so unfortunate as to find myself
      opposed to you. I admit frankly that I entirely underestimated your genius
      and your power. Since then, on one occasion you came within an ace of
      ruining me. On a second and more recent occasion you came within an ace of
      causing my death. Now, I have called at the captain&rsquo;s office to settle. In
      the language of the wild and woolly West, my hands are up, and you have
      the drop on me. What are your terms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments Nicholson regarded his visitor with an expression in
      which mild surprise was mingled with equally mild anxiety. When at last he
      spoke, his voice was perceptibly lowered, as if he addressed an invalid in
      a sick-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not looking very well, Mr. Steele?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor feeling well, either, Mr. Nicholson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hear it. What is the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amalgamated Soap, I should say,&rdquo; said John, with a dreary laugh.
      &ldquo;Excellent for the complexion, but mighty bad for the nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall make no pretence of misunderstanding your meaning, Mr. Steele,&rdquo;
       Nicholson went on with the patient enunciation one uses towards an
      unreasonable child. &ldquo;You are hinting that in revenge for fancied
      opposition on your part, either I personally or the company with which I
      am associated, or both, have entered into a conspiracy, first to rob, and
      secondly to murder you. I hesitate to speak so bluntly, but, as you quite
      sensibly remark, we should be frank with each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your bluntness is more than compensated for by your accuracy, Mr.
      Nicholson. What you describe is exactly what you have done. Mere accident
      saved me from ruin in the Consolidated Beet Sugar formation. Less than a
      month ago I was led across the plains by one of your minions&mdash;a most
      charming, beautiful, and fascinating young woman&mdash;into a death-trap,
      from which I escaped largely through my own ingenuity. Now, I have written
      down a rather vivid and strictly accurate account of these doings. I have
      put in your name, and that of Amalgamated Soap, and my own, and there are
      three copies of this narrative in existence, two of them with a slow match
      attached which you can very easily light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning that this interesting account will appear in print, Mr. Steele?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0291.jpg" alt="0291 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0291.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. Now, I ask you, Mr. Nicholson, is it worth while going any
      further with this feud? We&rsquo;re not illicit distillers in the mountains
      trying to pot-shot each other, but two supposedly sane men; and the world
      is amply wide enough for both. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Steele, it&rsquo;s rather difficult to know what to say without
      seeming impolite. Many things have been printed about Amalgamated Soap
      during the last twenty years, and so far they have never been replied to,
      nor have our dividends been adversely affected. A few of the articles I
      have read. Some were largely statistical, others of a defamatory
      character, others, again, contained the two qualities combined. But you,
      Mr. Steele, threaten to inject a most unusual and interesting quality&mdash;namely,
      that of an attractive young man journeying across the prairies with a
      beautiful and mysterious young woman. If I raised a finger to prevent the
      publication of a human document so well calculated to touch the better and
      more sentimental parts of our nature, I should consider that I was
      depriving my fellow-creatures of a source of pure enjoyment. I believe we
      sometimes unite beauty and soap in our advertisements. Attractive pictures
      they are. But this romance of the Black Hills&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it was the Black Hills?&rdquo; asked Steele quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you mention that locality?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said the plains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I beg pardon&mdash;this romance of the plains&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, stop a moment, Nicholson; just stop where you are. Do you see what a
      blunder you&rsquo;ve made? For your own purpose, whatever it may be, you have
      been pretending that this human document of mine, as you call it, is a
      myth. Yet, in the calm and choice language with which you are describing
      it, you have suddenly given yourself away. You know the mine was in the
      Black Hills, and, of course, I knew you knew from the very first. Now, let
      us quit sparring. I asked you what your terms were. I am not using threats
      at all. I am merely trying to come to an arrangement. Suppose, on the
      third attack, you succeed in driving me to the wall. What good will it do
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all, Mr. Steele, and I assure you I have not the least desire to
      interfere even in the remotest degree with your affairs. You evidently
      attribute to me more-power than I possess. The undertakings of our
      association are all matters of mutual arrangement between the directors,
      of whom I happen to be one. We meet each day at eleven o&rsquo;clock, and I
      trust you will believe me when I say that if I proposed to my colleagues
      either the robbery or murder of Mr. John Steele, I should be very promptly
      asked to resign my position, and deservedly so. Really, Mr. Steele, if I
      may make an appeal to your own common sense, you must admit that the
      building up of the prestige of this company, its successful carrying on,
      its increase of business in all parts of the world, are not accomplished
      by such bizarre devices as you ascribe to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that you did not, in my own presence, attempt to wreck
      the Consolidated Beet Sugar Company when you thought I would be ruined by
      it, and immediately go to allotment when you learned I had escaped the
      trap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad you mentioned that, Mr. Steele, because a few simple words
      will show you that I am not the Machiavelli you suppose me to be. To wreck
      you I should have been compelled to wreck ourselves to at least an equal
      amount, and it is not the custom of Amalgamated Soap to purchase revenge
      at so excessive a price. It is one of our principles never to enter into
      any company put before the public unless the capital is fully subscribed.
      To my surprise I learned that we were a million short, therefore I could
      not agree to go to allotment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you went to allotment all the same when you learned I was out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, it was not learning that you were out of it which caused me to
      change my mind. It was knowing you had sent a letter to the papers
      informing the public that we were interested in the Consolidated Beet
      Sugar Company. The moment our good name was involved I proposed going to
      allotment; but before doing so I myself drew my cheque for a million
      dollars and bought the unsold shares. Your being in or out of the Company
      had nothing to do with my action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not come to terms, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no terms to come to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your last word, Mr. Nicholson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will pardon the liberty I take, Mr. Steele, I shall venture some
      last words on another subject. As I said when you came in, you are not
      looking well. Do you know what paranoea means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you take my advice, you will consult a physician and ask him
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you, to save the physician&rsquo;s fee. What is paranoea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a disease of the brain, and its symptom is fear. The victim
      imagines that someone, or everyone, is plotting against him. All the
      energies he possesses are directed towards the circumvention of
      conspiracies that are wholly imaginary. This disease, if not checked,
      leads to insanity or suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does paranoea ever lead to murder, Mr. Nicholson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite frequently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then as I have been told that the directors of Amalgamated Soap are a
      most piously inclined body, please solicit their prayers that I may not be
      afflicted with the malady you mention. I thank you for giving me so much
      of your time, and now bid you &lsquo;Good day.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Steele,&rdquo; said Nicholson, rising; then speaking in his
      suavest manner, he said: &ldquo;If ever you entertain any project that requires
      more capital than you can command, I shall be most pleased to submit it to
      Mr. John Berrington, and perhaps we may be of assistance to you. As I told
      you before, I have the utmost admiration for your financial ability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Nicholson; I shall bear your kind invitation in mind.
      However, I may inform you that I have entirely dropped out of all
      speculative business. I am one of the few men who know when they have had
      enough. I have accumulated all the money I shall need during my lifetime,
      and I intend to take care of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most sensible resolution, Mr. Steele; and once more good-bye, with many
      thanks for the visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele walked up Broadway the most depressed man in New York. His
      attempted compromise had proven a complete failure; his journey East a
      loss of time. And yet of what value was time to him, who dared not
      undertake the most innocent project through fear of the developments that
      might follow? Nicholson had said that fear was the symptom of the malady
      he had so graphically depicted. Could it be possible, Steele asked
      himself, that he was actually the victim of a disease, every indication of
      which he seemed to possess? Nicholson had evidently planted that thought
      in his brain to his further disquietude. That man, who rarely allowed a
      smile to lighten his face, had inwardly laughed at him, flouted him,
      defied him! and all done with soothing, contemptuous insults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steele walked slowly up Broadway until he came to its intersection with
      Fifth Avenue, and then he followed the latter street, aimlessly making for
      his hotel. Nevertheless, when he came opposite the hotel he wandered past
      it and on up the Avenue. Suddenly he shook himself together and denied the
      cowardliness which he had hitherto attributed to the design forming in his
      mind. He would appeal to a woman, and if he could not thus circumvent the
      demoniac Nicholson, he would go out of business entirely, as he had
      threatened, and either travel or take up some interesting recreative
      occupation. He made inquiries, was directed to the Berrington residence,
      walked up the steps of that palace, and rang the bell. A servant in
      gorgeous livery opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to speak with Miss Berrington,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at &rsquo;ome, sir,&rdquo; was the curt answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steele put his hand in his pocket and drew forth a twenty-dollar bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the lady is in,&rdquo; he said quietly, handing this legal tender to
      the man in plush. Even in the residences of millionaires tips of this size
      are unusual, and the haughty menial at once melted. He pocketed the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she is not in town at all. Speaking confidentially,
      sir, Miss Berrington&rsquo;s that peculiar she don&rsquo;t like New York. Her ladyship&mdash;I
      beg your pardon, sir&mdash;Miss Berrington is at her country &rsquo;ome
      some distance out of town, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far? Where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a lake, sir. I don&rsquo;t quite remember its name. Begins with a h&rsquo;S, I
      think, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lake Saratoga?&rdquo; suggested Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It begins with a h&rsquo;S, sir,&rdquo; repeated the man thoughtfully; then with a
      sudden burst of inspiration: &ldquo;Oh, yes, sir, Superior&mdash;Lake Superior,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; cried Steele, unable to repress a smile, &ldquo;that isn&rsquo;t just
      exactly in the environs of New York. I suppose you couldn&rsquo;t tell me
      whether the house is on the Canadian or the United States side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I couldn&rsquo;t say, sir, being it&rsquo;s in Michigan, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s near enough; I can guess the rest.&rdquo; The man in plush
      pronounced the name of the State as if the first syllable were spelt
      M-i-t-c-h.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, her ladyship&mdash;beg your pardon&mdash;Miss Berrington owns a
      large estate there, so they tell me&mdash;thousands and thousands of
      acres, all covered with forests, and there&rsquo;s a big &rsquo;ouse full of
      servants; but her lady&mdash;but Miss Berrington receives nobody, sir. Not
      if you brought a letter from the King of Hengland, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! rather exclusive, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thanking the man, Steele turned away and walked down the Avenue to his
      hotel, resolved to let the Berring-tons or the Nicholsons do their worst.
      He would attempt no further parley with any of the gang, and&mdash;probably
      inspired by the accent of the servitor in plush&mdash;gave serious thought
      to the investing of all his money in British Consols, small as was the
      percentage granted by that celebrated security. He took it for granted
      that the Government of Britain was probably free from the influence of the
      Berrington crowd, and he was rapidly coming to the conclusion that no
      other sphere of human activity was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at his hotel, he found a telegram waiting for him. It proved to
      be from Philip Manson, and it ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Congratulate me. Have just been appointed president of the Wheat Belt
      System. Important development. Great opening here that just suits you.
      Must see you immediately. If you cannot come here, telegraph me, and I
      will go to New York.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye Gods!&rdquo; cried Steele, bracing back his shoulders, while the chronic
      look of anxiety vanished like mist before the sun, &ldquo;just at the point when
      I don&rsquo;t know what to do, here comes my chance. I&rsquo;ll bet a farm Manson is
      going to offer me the vice-presidency of the road. I&rsquo;ll take it like a
      shot, and raise the freight rates on soap if Philip will let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized a telegraph blank and wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Heartiest congratulations. The right man in right place. You need not
      come to New York, as I am leaving for home to-night. I shall accept your
      opening, whatever it is.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Before two days were past, John Steele was closeted with Manson in the
      president&rsquo;s room of the huge Wheat Belt building. The great, flat table in
      the centre was covered with broad maps taken from the civil engineer&rsquo;s
      department, maps unknown to the general public.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, John,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a position to offer you the absolute
      surety of doubling, trebling, or even quadrupling your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunder!&rdquo; cried Steele in a tone of disappointment, &ldquo;I thought you were
      going to present me with the vice-presidency of the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manson glanced up at him in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you take it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it? Of course. That&rsquo;s what I thought I was engaging to do when I
      telegraphed from New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no sooner said than done, John. I&rsquo;d no idea you wished to get back
      into the railway business. I should think a man who can make millions
      outside wouldn&rsquo;t be content to sit here at a salary of ten or fifteen
      thousand a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am tired of making millions,&rdquo; said Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; protested Manson with something like dismay in
      his words, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean to say you won&rsquo;t go in with us? I took your
      telegram as consent, and because I could thus guarantee the bringing in of
      a big capitalist, I have induced others to join and secured an extra slice
      for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where there are millions to be made,&rdquo; said Steele dubiously, &ldquo;there is
      always a risk, and I had determined not to accept any more chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no chance about this, John; it is a sure thing, and the
      development of it rests entirely in my hands. You can double your money
      and pull out within ten days after I give the word, and I&rsquo;ll give the word
      whenever you say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your project, Mr. Manson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, the Wheat Belt Line, which has been one of the most
      prosperous roads in the country for some years past, is going to build a
      branch running two hundred and seventy miles northwest until it taps the
      Wisconsin Pacific. This red line shows you where the road will run. The
      Wheat Belt Line has secured all the timber land on each side, but the
      former president, whose place I have taken, and myself have an option on
      the prairie and the stump-lands where timber has been cut. The president
      resigned simply to give his whole time to this land company, and that&rsquo;s
      why I am in his place. Now, we can get the property at prairie value just
      now; but the minute we begin surveying, up it will jump. You can trust me
      to keep my word. If you join us, I shall give the order for surveying the
      line the moment deeds of the land are in our possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much money do you expect me to put up, Mr. Manson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t invest twenty millions, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty millions! Heavens and earth, no! It would practically clean me out
      to furnish nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mentioned the bigger amount simply because I am sure you will double
      your money within a month, and the more you put in, the more you&rsquo;re going
      to take out. You see, this is not a speculation, but a certainty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes Steele walked up and down the room, hands deep in his
      pockets, as was his custom, brow wrinkled and head bent. At last he said,
      with the old ring of decision in his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Manson, I&rsquo;ll go in; but if I fail, you must give me the
      vice-presidency, as a sort of consolation prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it to you now,&rdquo; said Manson. &ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t fail. I tell you
      everything is in my hands. It is not as if this were any bluff. The
      proposed line is a road that is becoming more and more needed every day,
      and the land is good for the money, even if the road were never built.
      It&rsquo;s as safe as government bonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be going over ground already sufficiently covered to recount the
      history of the Western Land Syndicate. Steele had resolved not to invest
      more than half his fortune; but once a man is involved in an important
      enterprise, he rarely can predict where he will stop. A scheme grows and
      grows, and often the financier is compelled to involve himself more and
      more deeply in order to protect the money already ventured, and finally it
      becomes all or nothing. Besides this, every speculator is something of the
      gambler, and once the game has begun, the betting fever has him in its
      clutch. Before a month was past, Steele had not only paid over every
      dollar he possessed, but had also become deeply indebted to his bank. In
      borrowing from the bank he made his irretrievable mistake. As the
      president had said, the land was intrinsically worth the money paid for
      it; and if John Steele had merely risked his own assets, he might have
      been penniless for ten years, but he would ultimately have been sure of
      getting back what he paid, and probably a good deal more. But to borrow
      hundreds of thousands at sixty days, in the expectation that he would take
      profits enough to pay the loan before that time expired, was an action he
      himself, in less feverish moments, would have been the first to condemn.
      He felt the utmost confidence in his old friend, the new president, and it
      may be said at once that Manson throughout the history of what was known
      as the Great Land Bubble, was perfectly honest and sincere. He was merely
      a pawn on the board, moved by an unseen force of which he knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of the day when the final payment on the land was made,
      the president of the Wheat Belt Line entered the room of his subordinate
      with a piece of paper in his hand. His face was white as chalk and he
      could not speak. He dropped into a chair, before John Steele&rsquo;s desk, and
      the latter, with a premonition of what was coming, took the paper from his
      trembling hand. It was a telegram from New York, and ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Peter Berrington Estate has acquired control of the Wheat Belt
      system. The new Board of Directors yesterday resolved to abandon the
      Wisconsin Pacific Branch. If the branch is built at all, which is
      doubtful, it will begin a hundred and seventy miles West of the point
      formerly selected. You will, therefore, countermand at once any
      instructions previously given regarding the Wisconsin Pacific connection.
      The board also refuses to ratify the nomination of John Steele as
      vice-president of the road.&mdash;Nicholson.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; said John, with a laugh that sounded just a trifle hollow.
      &ldquo;Cheer up, old man. I know all about this, and you&rsquo;re not in the least to
      blame. You acted in good faith throughout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible, John, horrible; but still, you know, you have the land,
      and before long that will realise all you&rsquo;ve put in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Manson, I&rsquo;ve got the land; that&rsquo;s one consolation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he knew perfectly well he hadn&rsquo;t. He knew that when the sixty days
      were up the bank would foreclose, which was exactly what happened. There
      were practically no bidders for so large a plot, and Nicholson purchased
      the property for the exact amount owing to the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruin of John Steele was complete.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI&mdash;THE RICHEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE clearing in the
      primeval forest had been only partial, for several tall trees were left
      standing here and there, grouped around a log-house. The house itself, to
      a casual observer, resembled the dwelling of an ordinary pioneer, except
      that it was much larger than any residence a poor woodman ever erected. It
      was built of great pine logs, the ends roughly dovetailed together with a
      lumberman&rsquo;s axe. Where log lay on log, the interstices were plastered with
      clay. A broad verandah ran completely round the oblong building, a luxury
      which the pioneer usually denied himself. A settler would also have been
      contented to cover his roof with split oak clapboards, but here the
      refinement of yellow pine shingles was used, which not only kept out the
      weather better than the pioneer&rsquo;s economical device, but caused the tone
      of the broad roof to harmonise well with the hue of the bark on the logs;
      and as one approached the edifice from the forest, the whole structure
      standing out against the background of deep blue afforded by the lake and
      sky, formed a more pleasing colour scheme than might have been expected
      where contrasts were so vivid in that translucent air. Around the large
      log-house were grouped many other log-buildings, with no attempt at
      regulation and order. Each one appeared to have been put up as needed, and
      these ranged from an ordinary outhouse or shed to complete residences. A
      few hundred yards away from the verandah of the house, down a sloping
      lawn, lay sand of dazzling whiteness, and along these sands rippled the
      smallest waves of the largest lake in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      No such body of fresh water as Lake Superior exists anywhere else on
      earth. The water in bulk is blue; taken in detail, it is almost invisible;
      and this was strikingly illustrated by an adjunct of civilisation which no
      stretch of the imagination could attach to pioneer days. Anchored in the
      bay floated a large white steam-yacht, with two funnels and two slender,
      sloping masts. It seemed resting, not on the surface of the lake, but in
      mid-air, for the details of the twin screws, the long, level keel, and
      submerged part from prow to stern were as plain to the eye as the upper
      works or the funnels or the masts.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the south and east and west, this little oasis of civilisation was
      walled in by the eternal forest. To the north, blue lake and blue sky
      blended together. On this day in late summer the place was a paradise of
      solitude. The great lake, which on occasion could raise a storm that might
      swamp an Atlantic liner, was now placid and on its good behaviour. The
      only sound was the gentle whisper of the leaves in the forest and the
      impatient pawing of a horse, which a groom held, saddled, by the southern
      verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the open doorway there presently emerged a young woman, in a
      tight-fitting riding-habit, so short in the skirt that it looked like a
      walking dress rather than a costume for an equestrienne. The girl seemed
      very slight, and not as tall as the average woman. In spite of the frown
      on her brow, the face was redeemed from lack of amiability by some
      indescribable spiritual intellectuality which beamed from it. The whole
      figure gave an impression of gloom. The hair was black; the complexion
      almost that of an Italian woman. The eyes of velvet midnight could sparkle
      with dark anger, but at times they melted into a glance of appeal that was
      strangely pathetic, which partially redeemed the austerity of the other
      features. The costume was of unrelieved black, but the attention of a
      stranger invariably returned again and again to the face, puzzled by it.
      It seemed to stamp its owner as querulous, selfish perhaps, caring little
      for the feelings of others, yet nevertheless there sometimes fitted across
      it an expression indicating true nobility of character, that seemed to
      account for those many deeds of kindness, with which even a critical world
      credited the young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with cutting sharpness to her groom, who had not placed the
      horse to please her. The man did his best, but the animal was restive from
      its long wait, and with a curt word of impatience at what she called the
      stupidity of the groom, the girl sprang with great dexterity into her
      saddle, gathered the reins in her left hand, and flecked the animal a
      stinging stroke on the flank with her whip. The horse snorted and reared,
      pawing the air, and again the whip descended. Now he tried to bolt, but
      she held him firmly, in spite of her apparently slight physique, and at
      last the frightened horse stood there trembling, but mastered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I follow you, madam?&rdquo; inquired the groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask unnecessary questions!&rdquo; snapped the girl, scowling at him as if
      she were in half a mind to hit him as well as the horse with the whip. &ldquo;If
      I wished you to follow me, I should have told you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cringing groom raised his forefinger to the peak of his cap and slunk
      away. The horse would have cantered, feeling the exhilaration of the air
      and the delight of the day in its supple limbs, but the girl appeared to
      take a grim pleasure in restraining the ardour of her steed and forcing
      him to a slow walk. The horsewoman certainly rode well and looked well in
      the saddle, but her face was marred by an expression of chronic
      discontent, which perhaps had a right to be there, for she was accounted
      the richest woman in the world, living what she supposed to be the simple
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance Berrington was one of those unhappy persons whose every wish had
      been gratified almost before it could be expressed. Slight as she
      appeared, her health was excellent, and she had never yet come upon a
      crisis in life which money could not smooth away. It would have done her a
      world of good to be compelled to earn her living for a year, and meet a
      section of humanity she had never yet encountered, who cared not a rap
      whether she lived or died. But at this moment, when her ill-temper caused
      her to curb the eager horse to a slow walk, she was playing into the hands
      of the enemy in a manner that would have startled her had she but known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parallel with her course, a stooping man dodged from tree to tree. There
      was something of the stealthiness of the savage about him, and he took all
      the precautions of a savage to avoid observation&mdash;precautions that
      were unnecessary in this case, for the girl was absorbed in the conquering
      of her horse, and the horse&rsquo;s own hoofs in the pine needles made noise
      enough to render inaudible the footsteps of the pursuer. For more than a
      mile the conscious hunter and the unconscious hunted kept their course.
      The ground rose perceptibly all the way, but at last became tolerably
      level, and then the girl shook out the reins and settled herself for a
      gallop. But at that instant, the wary pursuer, who day after day during
      the past month had been baffled by the speed of the horse, sprang out from
      behind a tree and seized the bridle near the bit. The complexion of the
      woman became a shade less swarthy with the sudden fright of this assault,
      and although she did not cry out or scream, her inward panic was in no way
      lessened by the sight of the countenance turned upon her. It was the face
      of one in despair, and the fierce, vengeful light of the eyes betokened a
      mind perilously near to insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go my horse!&rdquo; she said in a low, tense voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man tightened his grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet!&rdquo; he retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her arm and struck the animal with all the force at her
      command, then with both hands jerked the reins and tried to ride down her
      obstructor. The horse reared and for a brief second lifted the man off his
      feet; but he held on, and horse and man came to the ground together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you try to do a trick like that again,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw both you
      and the horse! Drop that whip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of dropping it she raised it again, leaning forward this time to
      strike the man; but he sprang towards her, holding the rein in his right
      hand, and with his left caught the whip as it descended and wrenched it
      rudely from her grasp. For a moment she thought he was about to strike
      her, and her arm rose waveringly to protect her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Will</i> you keep still?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want money,&rdquo; she said in the quiet, semi-contemptuous tone with
      which she would have addressed a beggar, &ldquo;you might have the sense to know
      that I carry none with me in the forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want money,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and I <i>have</i> the sense to know you carry
      none with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how do you expect to obtain it by this violence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I shall have the pleasure of explaining to you a little further on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She folded her empty hands on her knee, now that he was possessed of both
      whip and rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise you, sir, to turn my horse&rsquo;s head in the other direction, and
      warn you that you will make less by threats than by trusting to my good
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reject your advice, Miss Berrington. The philanthropy of your family is
      well-known and widely advertised. Your good deeds rise up and call you
      blessed; but I am not an object of charity, although I may look it. The
      sum which I demand I shall exact by coercion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well. Set about it, then. Pray do not allow me to hinder you in
      the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Miss Berrington; you shall not.&rdquo; Placing the riding rein over
      his arm, he turned his back upon her and led the horse along the level
      towards the west for perhaps half a mile further, when he deflected to the
      right until they arrived at the top of a high cliff overlooking the lake.
      Neither had spoken a word during the journey, and Constance Berrington sat
      very rigidly on her led horse, like a clothed Lady Godiva, <i>sans</i> the
      beauty. The look of discontent, however, had vanished from her face, and
      the expression which took its place was not unpleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the cliff her leader stopped, swung round, and said gruffly, &ldquo;Get
      down!&rdquo; without, however, making any offer to assist her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang lightly from the saddle to the ground and stood there, as if
      awaiting further commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seat yourself on that log.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fallen tree which one of the winter storms had uprooted lay with its
      branches far out over the chasm. The girl sat down on the trunk as she had
      been directed. &ldquo;I am John Steele, of Chicago,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does not interest me,&rdquo; replied the young woman. &ldquo;Have you ever heard
      the name before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and don&rsquo;t wish to hear it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six months ago I was worth ten millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does not interest me, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not reiterate the statement, madam; I shall interest you before
      I am done with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were not so slow about it, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know a man named Nicholson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicholson tried first to ruin me and then to murder me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man paused, as if to allow this startling sentence to produce
      its effect. The young woman&rsquo;s eyes were upon the ground, but after a few
      moments of silence she glanced up at him with a languid air of
      indifference and said: &ldquo;Is this the interesting part? Is any comment
      expected of me? If so, I can only say that Mr. Nicholson is usually
      successful in what he attempts, and I deeply regret the failure of his
      second project. It would have saved me from a most unpleasant encounter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Steele, tightening his lips. &ldquo;I am glad you take it that
      way. Nicholson, as, of course, you know, was acting for the organisation
      which, I understand, contributes some fifty millions a year towards your
      support. In spite of your humane wish, he failed in his two attempts, but
      his third conspiracy succeeded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you were right, Mr. Steele, you <i>do</i> interest me. What did he
      endeavour to do on the third occasion? Consign you to a lunatic asylum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. To tell you the truth, madam, I feared that would come of itself. The
      fact that I have not gone mad under the silent persecution I was called
      upon to endure leads me to suppose that I shall hereafter be proof against
      any malady of the mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not in the least doubt that. Nothing can damage a sanity already
      destroyed. If you are not a lunatic, you are worse&mdash;a cowardly hound
      who dares to offer violence to an unprotected woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the colour mounted in John Steele&rsquo;s pale face, and a glint of
      admiration came into his eyes. The little woman was absolutely at his
      mercy, yet she said these words with perfect serenity and turned upon him
      a gaze that was quite fearless. He noticed now for the first time the
      gloomy depths of those dark eyes, and thought how much more steadfast and
      beautiful they were than the blue orbs which had crazed his brain on the
      plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not such a coward as you think me, madam. Now that we are entirely free
      from any chance of molestation, when you must recognise your own
      helplessness, I beg to assure you that I shall treat you with the utmost
      courtesy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. But let us get to the point. You are John Steele. You were
      worth ten millions. Nicholson plotted against you and ruined you.
      Nicholson is one of the combination in New York from which I draw my
      money. In spite of what you say, you are too much of a coward to face
      Nicholson; therefore you have endeavoured to kidnap me and terrorise me
      into giving you a cheque for ten million dollars. How near am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are exactly right, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Although I am no admirer of Mr. Nicholson, nevertheless, it is
      easy to see why he defeated you. A man who takes so long to reach the
      kernel of his business may be all very well in Chicago, but he has no
      right to pit himself against a citizen of New York. I refuse to give you
      one penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;give,&rsquo; madam, I beg of you. &lsquo;Restore&rsquo; is the word. As I told
      you, I am making no appeal to the renowned philanthropy of the
      Berringtons. My ten millions, although lost to me, have gone into the
      coffers of your company. You have no more right to the money than I have
      to this horse. I own that amount because I made it without cheating
      anybody. I made it legitimately. I demand it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already refused. What is your next move?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My next move will take some little time to tell, and you are so impatient
      of my loquacity that I almost fear to venture&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pray go on!&rdquo; she cried wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the height make you dizzy? I should like to have you look over this
      cliff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make me in the least dizzy. I know the cliff very well, and
      have been here many times. There are five or six hundred feet of sheer
      precipice, then a ledge of rock, then the lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have described it admirably, madam. Well, what I shall do is this. I
      possess, within a mile and a half of this place, a log cabin not so large
      or comfortable as your house. I intend to take you there and to hold you
      prisoner until I receive back what is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Nicholson would have mapped out a more feasible plan. How long do you
      think I shall remain captive without being found? To-morrow there will be
      a hue and cry after me&mdash;to-night, indeed, if I do not return. I shall
      be tracked by dogs, or an Indian will be got and put on the trail. Your
      scheme is absurd, Mr. Steele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forgotten the cliff, madam. I shall lead your horse to the edge
      of the cliff, strike him with your whip, and send him over. He will lie
      dashed to death on the ledge six hundred feet below. The Indian or the dog
      will trace the horse to this cliff. It will be naturally supposed that you
      have been flung into the waters of the lake, which are another six hundred
      feet deep. Then the search will end, madam. Lake Superior never gives up
      its dead, and to dredge at that depth is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;your plan is better than I thought. There
      is just the risk that the horse, poor creature, may bound from the ledge
      into the lake, and in that case the search would not end at the cliff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, she rose and walked bravely to the very brink, looking over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go so near!&rdquo; cried John Steele, taking a step towards her. She paid
      no heed to him, and for a moment he held his breath in alarm as she walked
      along the extreme edge of the precipice. Then she turned listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the ledge is quite wide enough for your purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have planned it all out,&rdquo; replied John, relief coming to his voice
      as she turned away from danger with her head lowered as if in deep
      thought. Then she took him entirely unawares. With a spring forward like
      that of a lynx, she jerked the reins from his unprepared hand. Striking
      the horse sharply with the loose leather, making him snort and shy with
      fear, she then smote him with her open palms on the flank, and away he
      galloped in a panic of fright. The face she turned to the astonished man
      seemed transformed. The black eyes danced with delight. She sank to the
      log again, shaking with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I was wrong, Mr. Steele, when I said you didn&rsquo;t interest me! You do,
      you do! I have never met so interesting a man before. In twenty minutes,
      or thereabout, the riderless horse will gallop into my courtyard. Now, Mr.
      John Steele, of Chicago, what is the next move?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010"> </a>
    </p>

      <a href="images/0317.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, logically,&rdquo; said John Steele, unable to repress a smile, grave as
      was his situation and quick his recognition of its seriousness, &ldquo;logically
      the next move should be for me to throw you over the cliff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that wouldn&rsquo;t be logical. It seems, to the poor reason that a woman
      possesses, Mr. Nicholson is the man who should be thrown over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am rather inclined to agree with you, Miss Berrington; but, alas!
      Nicholson is in New York, and you are the only member of the company now
      in my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure I am in your power?&rdquo; she asked, looking up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankly, I&rsquo;m inclined to doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t laughed for years,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not since I was a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re nothing more than a girl now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I act like it,&rdquo; she replied, flushing slightly, and that
      evidently not from displeasure. &ldquo;You are mistaken about Mr. Nicholson
      being in New York. Did you see that white yacht in front of my house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it belongs to Mr. Nicholson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he your guest?&rdquo; asked John, the light of battle coming into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he is in Duluth. He went there a few days ago in his yacht, and sent
      the vessel back, in case I should wish a sail on the lake. Shall I arrange
      a meeting between you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you will not credit me, Miss Berrington, when I tell you that I
      do not wish to meet Mr. Nicholson, and it is not cowardice which keeps me
      from the encounter. If I met him, I should kill him; then the law would
      hang me, and I have no desire to be executed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are quite safe in Michigan,&rdquo; said the girl encouragingly; &ldquo;there
      is no capital punishment in this State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had forgotten about that, if I ever knew it. You see, I live in
      Illinois, and Nicholson lives in New York. In the one State they hang, and
      in the other they electrocute. It may be weak in me, but I shrink from
      either of those ordeals, much as I detest Nicholson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl rose to her feet, put up both hands to her hair, and arranged the
      black tresses that had gone astray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you possessed your log cabin, Mr. Steele?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two months. One month I have spent round your house watching for
      you; but you have always left on a canter, or else that confounded groom
      of yours was following you, and I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt him. In truth, I
      didn&rsquo;t wish to hurt anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man! have you been lingering in the forest all that time? No wonder
      you look like an escaped convict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; asked John in alarm, glancing down at his ragged garments. &ldquo;I
      suppose I do. Since I came into the forest I have paid no attention to my
      personal appearance. Pray accept my apologies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mention it. I imagine you didn&rsquo;t expect to meet a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been frustrated so often that I suppose I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, then, my nearest neighbour? By the rights of etiquette I should
      have made the first call, being the older resident. I think, however, Mr.
      Steele, that your methods of teaching me politeness to a new-comer were
      somewhat rough. So, if you will excuse me, I shall not go with you to your
      log-cabin this evening. It is getting late; see how low the sun has sunk,
      and how gloriously he lights up the lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Steele dolefully, &ldquo;it reminds me of the copper situation
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is copper that brings Mr. Nicholson to this district,&rdquo; she replied
      brightly, &ldquo;although I suppose I should not tell that to an opposing
      speculator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn Nicholson!&rdquo; cried John hastily; then: &ldquo;Really, I beg your
      pardon, madam. I have been a savage these two months past, as you very
      rightly remarked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to say,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that if you will waive etiquette and
      come and dine with me to-night, I shall be very glad of your company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Miss Berrington, that is heaping coals of fire on this tousled head
      of mine. I could not venture into a civilised household in these rags. I
      am sure you will excuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I shall not. I make a bold appeal to your gallantry. I do not know
      my way; I am certain to get lost in the forest. You see, my horse has
      always been my guide, and, entirely through your fault, my horse is no
      longer here to lead me through the woods, so please be my pathfinder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, certainly, I&rsquo;ll lead you to the gates, but don&rsquo;t ask me to
      come in. I&rsquo;m very much ashamed of myself, and I assure you that if your
      horse were here, I should help you to mount, and allow you to depart
      unscathed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t help me to dismount,&rdquo; said the girl, glancing at him with eyes
      brimful of mischief, and laughing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      With something of his old-time heartiness, Jack laughed at her readiness
      of repartee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not hold that against me. We were not acquainted then. It
      seems years ago, instead of minutes. I think if you and I had met when I
      first called on you, my later troubles would all have been averted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they did not tell me you had called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My visit was to your palace on Fifth Avenue, where I was received by a
      gorgeous individual with a cockney accent, whose knowledge of geography
      was such that he supposed Lake Saratoga and Lake Superior were neighbours
      and about of a size.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? You met Fletcher then? Poor man, he is quite lost now, for I have
      him here with me in the woods. Nicholson brought him in the yacht. I
      rather suspect that the quiet Mr. Nicholson wishes to acquire this man&rsquo;s
      services; but, thank goodness, I can always outbid him, and Fletcher is
      peculiarly susceptible to the charms of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fletcher seems to be in demand, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is most useful, but I fancy&mdash;which is a word he is very fond
      of&mdash;that he is very unhappy, for I have compelled him to abandon the
      gorgeous raiment you mentioned and dress as a northern farmer. I fear I
      shall need to restore his plumage, for he seems to think he has lost caste
      entirely. I am unable to convince him that he has gained it; but perhaps
      when he sees you in such raiment, and learns you were worth ten millions
      six months ago, he will be reconciled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were walking homeward through the forest, but at this remark John
      stopped and said ruefully: &ldquo;Look here, Miss Berrington, if you are merely
      taking me with you to show Fletcher how badly a man may be costumed, I
      shall at once return to my cabin, for I have another suit there. I think
      that allusion to my clothes was most unkind, just as I was trying to
      forget them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I am going to turn you over to Fletcher, who will see that you are
      clothed, now that you are in your right mind. I think this is the spot
      where I first had the pleasure of meeting you, Mr. Steele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s another subject you are not to refer to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, I must get you to write out a list of them,&rdquo; and the sprightly
      little woman looked up at him with merriment sparkling in her fine eyes.
      No one would have recognised her as the Tartar who a short time before had
      browbeaten her servant and lashed her horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry rang out through the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are looking for me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Answer the call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Steele lifted up his voice and gave utterance to a piercing scream
      that rent the silence like the soul-scattering screech of a locomotive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless us and keep us!&rdquo; cried Constance Berrington, covering her small
      ears with her small hands, &ldquo;is that an Indian war-whoop, that once used to
      resound in this wilderness?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s the acme of civilisation; merely a college yell. If any of your
      people are graduates of Chicago University they&rsquo;ll recognise it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The people who were not graduates of anything, except the college of hard
      labour, hurried to meet them with anxious faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not in the least hurt,&rdquo; said Constance Berrington quite
      composedly. &ldquo;I was merely compelled to dismount more rapidly than I
      usually do. Did the horse get home all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then everything is as it should be. Luckily this gentleman was near
      by, and I came to no harm. Fletcher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dejected, crestfallen man came slowly to the front, while she advanced
      a few rapid steps toward him, gave him some instructions in an undertone,
      and the search-party left under his leadership for the house, Steele and
      the girl following them at their leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How true it is that fine feathers make fine birds!&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I should
      never have recognised Fletcher, whom I once took to be the finest specimen
      of our race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a poor rule that doesn&rsquo;t work both ways,&rdquo; laughed the girl. &ldquo;Did you
      notice that Fletcher failed to recognise you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I <i>will</i> go back and get that other suit!&rdquo; cried John, coming to
      a standstill. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait dinner for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she said, letting her hand rest for one brief moment on his
      arm. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think men were so vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t know much about them, Miss Berrington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t until to-day. I&rsquo;ve had my eyes opened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must make one proviso. You are to return my visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you wear the other suit, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will; and besides that, I have a negro cook who can prepare a meal
      that will surprise you, in our neck of the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A negro cook? Dear me, I thought you were ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, in a manner of speaking, so I am, now you mention it; but
      still, let us live by the way, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the clearing, Fletcher was awaiting them on the
      verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will come with me, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall take you to the
      guest-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner at seven. Fletcher will show you the way to the dining-room. Until
      then, <i>au revoir!</i>&rdquo; and the girl disappeared into the log-house,
      while Fletcher escorted Steele to a building near by and ushered him into
      a sumptuous bedroom facing the lake. On the bed was laid out a suit of
      evening clothes and all that pertained to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you will find this about your size, sir. If not, I can get you
      one larger or smaller, as you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; said Steele, &ldquo;do you keep a clothing store out here in
      the backwoods?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well sir, for a country &lsquo;ouse situated as this is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far from London, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, sir, we are very well stocked, sir. And now sir, if you&rsquo;d like
      a hair-cut, or your beard trimmed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! do you employ a barber, too? Thank Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, you see, I used to be servant to General Sir Grundy Whitcombe,
      of the British Army, sir, and they do be particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to hint you can shave me, Fletcher, and cut my hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, Fletcher, you don&rsquo;t like look an angel, but that&rsquo;s exactly what
      you are. I&rsquo;ll have the beard cut away entirely, but leave the moustache
      where it is; and if you give me the hair-crop of a British general, why,
      I&rsquo;ve nothing more to ask in this life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; consented the admirable Fletcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the task was finished, and John looked at the result in the mirror,
      he absent-mindedly thrust his hand into his pocket, but brought it forth
      empty. Fletcher was regarding him with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; cried the young man, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a sou markee on me; but I
      won&rsquo;t forget you, Fletcher. I&rsquo;ll see you later, as we say out West, and
      you won&rsquo;t lose by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I think I remember you now, sir; and if I may make so bold as
      to say it, sir, I&rsquo;m already in your debt. Her Ladyship&mdash;I mean, Miss
      Berrington&mdash;being as she was thrown from her horse, sir, and you &rsquo;andy
      to &rsquo;elp &rsquo;er, you got the right kind of introduction, after
      all, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Fletcher, it seems like it, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII&mdash;TO THE SOUND OF THE SILVER CHIME
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> GREAT deal of
      nonsense has been written about the inartistic qualities of the modern
      man&rsquo;s evening clothes. The truth is that no other costume so befits a
      stalwart, good-looking young fellow. It is in plain black and white, and
      affects none of the effeminacy of lace and ruffles and colour which made a
      fop of the dandy centuries ago. There is a manly dignity about
      dinner-dress which nothing else can give, except perhaps a suit of armour,
      but armour, unless it be chain mail, develops inconveniences at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Miss Berrington entered the dining-room, and found her guest standing
      by the huge open log-fire, awaiting her, she stopped still for a moment in
      amazement, and then an expression of unqualified admiration came over her
      ever-changing face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated, as he came eagerly forward with a
      smile to meet her, &ldquo;is this really Mr. Steele?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Fletcher&rsquo;s Mr. Steele, madam. You have tamed the bear, Miss
      Berrington, and Fletcher has groomed him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember, Mr. Steele, that you interdicted the topic of costume; but
      may I be permitted the vanity of congratulating Fletcher and myself on our
      collaboration?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John laughed as he led her to the head of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my youth I read once of an enchanted land, presided over by a fairy
      princess so gracious and so good that when outside barbarians wandered
      into her realm, they became what we would call civilised; but I never knew
      this land and this princess existed until to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the soft glow of the shaded candles the expressive face of the girl
      seemed almost handsome. She wore no jewels, but even the young man&rsquo;s
      uncritical eye could not mistake the richness and exquisite design of her
      evening gown, which indicated that if this young woman shunned society,
      she had nevertheless chosen an artist for her dressmaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was so excellent that Steele regretted he had mentioned his
      negro cook. White-fish from the icy waters of Lake Superior is unequalled
      by anything that swims, unless it be the brook-trout which the northern
      streams that enter Lake Superior produce. Wild turkey of the Michigan
      woods is world-renowned as the choicest of game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Steele&rsquo;s hostess drank nothing but cold spring water, an ancient
      and renowned vintage sparkled at his right hand. It is little wonder that
      Jack, healthily hungry, was brilliant that evening as even he had never
      been before, and this poor, rich girl who listened, delighted and amazed,
      began to wonder if, after all, she had not missed a good deal in life by
      flouting smart society which she considered frivolous.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, Constance Berrington put a shawl over her shoulders and
      asked her guest if he would come outside and see the lake glittering in
      the moonlight. On the verandah he found the unique arrangement of an
      out-of-doors fireplace facing the platform, and in its depths roared a
      hickory fire, which burns with a flame bright as electric light, and
      leaves an ash white as flour. Two screens of sailcloth drawn like curtains
      along the roof of the verandah partially fenced in this snug spot, leaving
      it open only towards the lake. The pale yacht lay like a liner&rsquo;s ghost on
      the silver sea, bathed in the light of the moon, and now and then the
      phantom ship gave forth melodious sounds as it chimed the hours in
      nautical fashion, the peal sweetly mellowed by the intervening water. John
      laughed in boyish glee to find himself in such a Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw anything so beautiful,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;nor have I ever known so
      ambitious a fireplace, trying to warm all outdoors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two rocking-chairs awaited them, and between these chairs stood a round
      table, on which the silent servant placed coffee and liqueurs. The hickory
      fire kindled a gleam of ineffable satisfaction in the young man&rsquo;s eyes
      when a box of prime cigars was placed before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I really smoke?&rdquo; he asked, taking one between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that is what they are for,&rdquo; replied the girl, with a smile,
      rocking gently to and fro. Then, when they were alone she said seriously:
      &ldquo;Mr. Steele, I want you to tell me the particulars of the conspiracies you
      referred to, that proved so disastrous to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear princess,&rdquo; he answered earnestly, &ldquo;do you think I am going to talk
      finance in the land of enchantment? Not likely. Do monetary centres exist
      in the world? I don&rsquo;t believe it. Are people struggling anywhere to defeat
      one another? This silver silence denies it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the silence is not going to deny me,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;I must know.
      You said I was responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said such a thing? Never! That is a mistake in identity. You are
      thinking of the barbarian whom you quite justly tried to ride down in the
      forest. He said many stupid and false things, for which I refuse to assume
      responsibility. Reluctantly I admit that that barbarian was my ancestor,
      but a thousand years have passed since he lived, and I say the race has
      improved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blew a whiff of smoke into the still air and, watching it waft upward,
      murmured softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet those wretched comic papers say a woman cannot choose cigars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad they are good. It was not I who selected them, but Mr.
      Nicholson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If some of the icy water of Lake Superior had unexpectedly dropped upon
      him, he could not have appeared more startled than at the mention of this
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye gods!&rdquo; he whispered huskily, &ldquo;I had forgotten that man existed! For
      years he has never been out of my mind before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s eloquent eyes were fixed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The smoke has disappeared into the blue,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but that name has
      brought you to earth again. Now tell me what he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Berrington,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;you are no more responsible for what
      Nicholson did, than I am for the actions of the savage who seized your
      horse. Let me forget again that either the white Indian or the savage ever
      lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she persisted, &ldquo;you must tell me.&rdquo; And so he told her, sometimes
      puffing at his cigar like a steam-engine, again almost allowing it to go
      out. The narration was vivid, but possibly it might have been more
      interesting if he had not substituted the father for the daughter in the
      case of Miss Alice Fuller. When the recital was finished the girl shivered
      a little; and seeing that he noticed it she said: &ldquo;I think it is getting
      cold, in spite of our fire. And now I shall bid you &lsquo;Good night.&rsquo; I must
      thank you for the most interesting day and evening I ever spent in my
      life. Good night, and I hope you will not dream of Mr. Nicholson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and took the hand she offered, raising it, before she was aware,
      to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know of whom I shall dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed a little and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the maid had girded round her the soft and trailing dressing-gown,
      bidding her mistress &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; Constance Berrington opened the window,
      knelt down before it, placed her elbows on the low sill, with her chin on
      her open palms, and remained thus gazing at the moonlit lake. The ship of
      mist tolled the unheeded hours as on a silver chime. At last, with a sigh
      that seemed to end in a sob, she murmured: &ldquo;Oh, how beautiful the world
      is, and yet I never appreciated it before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she closed her window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The informative Fletcher told Steele that the breakfast hour was nine, and
      the grandfather clock was striking as he entered the dining-room next
      morning. The fragrance of the coffee-urn was stimulating to a man from the
      keen outer air, and the girl who presided over it turned towards him a
      smiling face, radiant as the dawn. Steele spread out his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of this?&rdquo; he cried, jovial as a lad with a holiday.
      &ldquo;This is the other suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; replied Constance Berrington. &ldquo;How came it here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was up this morning before five, donned my rags, tramped to my hut,
      comforted my negro, who was nearly white with panic at my absence, put on
      the other suit, and here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you do not enjoy your breakfast after that, I shall admit my
      cook inferior to your negro. Why didn&rsquo;t you take one of the horses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never thought of it. I seemed to be walking in midair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come down to earth, and buckwheat pancakes and maple syrup. Do you
      prefer tea or coffee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, coffee, of course. The aroma excels all the perfumes of Araby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast was even more intimate and delightful than the dinner had
      been. Daylight had not removed the glamour of the moon from the land of
      enchantment. When the meal was finished, Constance Berrington rose and
      said: &ldquo;Before you go, I wish to show you my library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her into this attractive room, its walls lined with books.
      Here and there were cosy alcoves and recesses, with leather-covered
      easy-chairs that might have graced a metropolitan club. A very solid table
      of carved oak occupied the centre of the room, and beside this the girl
      came to a stand, while he glanced around him in admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had much time for reading,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I do envy you this
      room. My own library is small, consisting mainly of books by friends of
      mine who kindly presented me with some of their writings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wish you to accept a specimen of my works. My writings may not be
      very literary, but they are concise and to the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she placed a slip of paper before him, and glancing at it he saw it
      was a cheque for ten millions. Then he looked up at her, a slow smile
      coming to his lips, and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Princess, this is for the savage, not for me. The savage is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are his heir, remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we are too far removed from each other, the savage and I. Remember
      the centuries between us, and less than ten years outlaws all claim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must accept it. It is mere transference, as you quite rightly pointed
      out. It does not belong to me, but to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman spoke with tense eagerness, and the former frown came into
      her brow before she had finished. He picked up the cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she said, with a sigh of relief; but the smile broadened
      on his face as he slowly tore the signature from the cheque and placed her
      autograph in his pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the hope that this may prove my return ticket to Paradise, and I
      am satisfied. Miss Berrington, you called me a coward yesterday, and you
      spoke the truth. I was, but I hope I am one no longer. I am young and
      reasonably ambitious. The world is before me. I shall begin where I began
      half-a-dozen years ago. I do not need your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall write you another cheque&mdash;you must accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am your guest, and I forbid you. The rules of hospitality,
      madam, extend even to the land of enchantment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the guest so cruel, then&rdquo;&mdash;there was a pathetic quaver in the
      voice&mdash;&ldquo;as to leave his hostess to brood over this weight of
      obligation? Will he not thus, in the only possible way, lift that weight
      from her shoulders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried John, coming swiftly round the table to her, &ldquo;I shall lift her
      and the obligation together,&rdquo; and, suiting the action to the word, he
      picked her up as if she were a child and seated her on the table before
      him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not accept your cheque, but I ask you to accept me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant her eyes blazed up as if lighted from within, then dulled
      again. She did not in the least resent his boisterous action, but she
      shook her head and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never marry a man who is not in love with me, and I am too
      insignificant a woman for any man to love me for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insignificant! Magnificent is the word! Why, Constance Berrington, you
      are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Your face makes every other
      in the world insipid. I&rsquo;m not going to try and persuade you that I love
      you, because you know it. You knew it last night. You saw it in my eyes,
      and I saw the knowledge in yours. Curse the money! I&rsquo;ll make all the money
      I need if I have you by my side. What is money, anyhow? I&rsquo;ve made it and
      lost it, and I can make it again and lose it again. Constance, let us take
      that yacht, go to Duluth, and be married before a magistrate for ten
      dollars, like a lumberman and his girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him and smiled, then down again, then up once more, and
      he kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;There is some one coming!&rdquo; A knock sounded at the
      door, and Miss Berrington sprang down from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your foot has touched the electric bell that is under the carpet,&rdquo; she
      whispered quickly, with a nervous laugh; then &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; she cried, and
      the servant entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steele was turning the pages of a magazine; Constance Berrington stood in
      the middle of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ring, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, tell the captain to get the yacht ready. I am going to Duluth.&rdquo;
     </p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
